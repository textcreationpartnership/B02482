            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But I had rather ſee the King in his plaineſt cloaths, then his fool in a painted coat. Where is the Scribe? where is the wiſe? where is the diſputer of this world? The loftineſſe of man muſt be laid low, his glory buried in the duſt, all his perfections come to an end: but if thou deſireſt to ſee truth in a comely dreſſe, &amp; cleer complexion, thou maiſt have a full view thereof in this enſuing Diſcourſe. Say not the Treaſiſe is too ſmal to contain ſo vaſt a ſubject, but rather admire his skill that diſcovers ſo much of heaven through ſo ſmal a proſpective. Wee applaud their art that contract the wide world into the narrow compaſſe of a ſlender Map: What a deal of worth is in a little Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond? How do men prize the duſt of gold?

If thou ask what is in this?

But this I ſhall bee bold to affirm, there's no <hi>Antinomianiſme</hi> in the Title or Tract; and from all vicious licentiouſneſſe of life, and ſcandalous aſperſions caſt on his perſon by lying lips, I ſtand upon mine owne experience, and more than twelve yeers know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to vindicate him; let the father of lies, and all his brood come forth and make good their charge againſt him.

            <p>Try him now, and judge, thou wilt find no poiſon in his hive; no Serpent lurks under his leaves; <hi>Tolle, lege,</hi> come, and ſee whether Jeſus
<pb facs="tcp:175622:9"/>of <hi>Nazareth</hi> be not here; not ſealed up in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, &amp; guarded with a rude train to keep his Diſciples from him, as the High Prieſts uſe to do; but thou ſhalt find him in his garden, opening his fountaine, blowing on his ſpices, leading into his banqueting-houſe, ſtaying with flaggons, comforting on every ſide: thou ſhalt find more in this booke then I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; only be perſwaded to peruſe it; if thou loveſt thy reſt, read it: Here is newes of drye land, footing for thy ſoul, the Olive branch doth witneſſe it; feare not, be not diſmayed; the waters are abated; let not thy ſloth make thee guilty of thy miſery. Will not the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-beaten Marriner employ all his ſtrength and oars to thruſt into a quiet harbour? Is any thing more deſired by the chaſed Hart, then the cooling ſtreams? How do men, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the enemie, rejoyce in the ſhelter of a ſtrong hold? Can any thing be more welcome to a notorious offender, juſtly condemned, then a gracious pardon? Is not God and his Righteouſneſſe all this, and much more to a poor creature in ſuch conditions? Behold, an Haven, a Brooke, a Tower, a Pardon, a full, a free Pardon, a Ranſome for thy ſoule; the righteouſneſſe of God breaking through the ſides, the hands, the heart of Chriſt, to make way to thee, to revive thy ding, droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:175622:10"/>bleeding heart. Incline thine ear, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the time to come; hear, and thy ſoul ſhall live; forſake not thine owne mercies, to obſerve lying vanities; leane not to the reeds of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when thou haſt the rod of Gods ſtrength put into thy hand: Shal there be a price in the hand, and no heart to it?

                  </gap> ſtead of that confuſion that was among them in reſpect of their madneſſe; hee deſires them to deale ſomewhat rationally with him, hee chargeth the world to put out all the ſtrength it hath, <hi>Bring forth your ſtrongeſt reaſons, Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> intending to heare what they could ſay for themſelves in their oppoſition of Chriſt; for ſo
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:175622:18"/>you ſee plainly in the ſecond verſe there, when the Lord had got ſilence, hee pleads the cauſe of Chriſt, by way of expoſtulation, as if hee had ſaid: what madneſſe is it in you, to ſet your faces againſt this ſetting up of Chriſt? <hi>For who hath raiſed up the righteous man, and called him to his feete, and given him to rule over Kings?</hi> Why doe you contend in this manner? can you tell who it is that ſets him up? If yee did but know againſt whom ye riſe up, it would appeare to your ſelves to be a vain contention; And therefore in the fourth verſe of this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> he anſwers the queſtion himſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhewes the vanity of their oppoſing him. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Lord hath done it, who is the firſt, and who is the laſt.</hi> If you fight with me, what will you get by it? Be ye ſure, I will manage the thing, it is the worke of mine owne hands, and it is I that raiſe him up, even to rule over Kings. and therefore you doe but kick againſt the pricks, in your contending with me.</p>
               <p>The Lord proceeds further, to ſhew the certainty of the prevalency of Chriſt, in the latter end of the ſecond verſe, and in the third verſe, he goes on, to let us ſee the fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lity of Chriſts prevalency, and not onely the facillity, but alſo the extent of the prevalency of Chriſt, both how eaſily, and how far he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:175622:19"/>
               <p>This matter is of excellent conſideration, <hi>He ſhall purſue,</hi> ſaith the Text, and he ſhall paſſe on <hi>ſafely,</hi> or, as it is in the margent, <hi>he ſhall paſſe on in peace,</hi> as much as to ſay, when Chriſt takes upon him to ſet up his owne Kingdome and glory in the world, every one that ſets his face againſt him, ſhall flye before him, and Chriſt will be the purſuer, and in the purſuit, he will ſo overtake them in the flight, that they ſhall be eaſily deſtroyed. Therefore Chriſt ſhall run quietly and ſoftly, he ſhall not run after them too haſtily, there ſhall be ſuch ſoftneſſe in the purſuit of Chriſt, that the overcomming of the oppoſers ſhall ſeem to be a time of peace, there ſhall be ſuch little oppoſition of him.</p>
               <p>In the fifth verſe, the Lord goes on, and tells of the fruit of this conqueſt, and the victory Chriſt ſhall have when he comes to reign in his. Church: the firſt fruit of it, is terror to them that ſet their faces againſt the Kingdome of Chriſt, <hi>the Ilands were afraid:</hi> Secondly, the Lord ſhewes what an ill uſe they made of this feare, whereas it ſhould make them ſtoop to the Scepter of Chriſt that was too hard for them: like malefactors indeed, when they ſaw themſelves overmaſtered, they aſſembled, and gathered themſelves together, they hoped to raiſe up more forces, and then they will try it out once more againe with Chriſt. Beſides, you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:175622:19"/>may obſerve, what a politike, devilliſh practice they uſe, to bring downe Chriſt againe when he was raiſed, that which hath been the main and grand plot of Satan, even to raiſe up Idols, and ſet them up by Chriſt, to ſteale away the hearts of people. It was the policy of <hi>Balaam,</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling <hi>Balak</hi> to lay ſtumbling blockes before <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to intice them unto the Idols of <hi>Moab;</hi> and it was the counſell of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Kingdome of Chriſt, to ſet up Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> that ſo there may not be a going unto Chriſt. So you have it in the ſeventh verſe; <hi>The Carpenter incouraged the Goldſmith,</hi> &amp;c. Well, the Lord having thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered what oppoſition there would be, at the ſetting up of Chriſt; begins to ſpeake ſomewhat comfortably unto his owne, giving incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his own people: the oppoſition indeed of the world never ſtirs, nor moves God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he know well enough how he can blaſt every attempt: yet, becauſe he knowes that his people have ſome fleſh remaining ſtill in them, the appearance of a tumult, and the oppoſition of the Goſpell may, peradventure, put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an affright. The Lord therefore endeavours to hearten his own people, againſt the frights that they might take, in regard of the outward appearance of oppoſition; and this he doth in the words of the Text: <hi>Feare thou not, for I am
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:175622:20"/>with thee: bee not diſmayed, for I am thy God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, leſt there ſhould be a miſtake to whom the Lord directs this ſpeech; for the intent of the Lord may be miſtaken in the extent of the people to whom hee ſpeakes; and therefore in the 8. and 9. verſes, the Lord ſhews to whom he ſpeaks ſuch incouragements: <hi>But thou Iſrael art my ſervant, and Jacob, whom I have choſen, the ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>my friend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Why ſome will ſay, It ſeemes then that in this Text, Gods ſpeaking of comfort, and encouragement, is confined onely unto the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> that are the children of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore what ever comfort there is in the Text, there is little comfort belongs unto us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Conſider the ninth verſe, and then it will appear, that though God ſpeakes of <hi>Jacob, Iſrael,</hi> and the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet he doth not ſpeak of the ſeed according to the fleſh, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit; for in the ninth verſe, you read the words thus: <hi>Thou whom I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and taken from the ends of the earth.</hi> That <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> then, and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom the Lord ſpeakes theſe comfortable words, is the <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> that is called from the ends of the earth. Now, if you would know what is meant by <hi>the ends of the earth,</hi> the Prophet will tell you, in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:175622:20"/>chap. 43. of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and the 5,6,7. verſes, <hi>Feare not, for I am with thee, I will bring thy ſeed from the Eaſt, and gather thee from the Weſt; I will ſay to the North, Give up, and to the South, Keepe not back: bring my Sonnes from farre, and my Daughters from the ends of the earth, even every one that is called by my name.</hi> As much as to ſay, this <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> to whom the Lord ſpeaks, not to feare, is a people gathered from the Eaſt, and from the North, and from the South, and from the Weſt; now the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is not of that extent, as to over-ſpread the World every way, however, the laſt clauſe, that it is, <hi>even every one that is called by his name,</hi> puts it out of doubt, that it extends alſo to us <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I note, beloved, that ſo we may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have a gueſſe that the comfortable language frequently mentioned by the Prophet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto us, as wel as the <hi>Jews:</hi> but that we may ſee that it is the mind of the Lord, that he hath revealed it himſelf, that it doth indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelf unto us; for, by the way, ſolid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort wil not be raiſed upon meer gueſſes or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, taking things for granted, without the ſenſe of a good foundation to bear up ſuch comforts. All the comfort people have, when they runne upon gueſſes, is onely abiding with them ſo long as there is not adminiſtred an
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:175622:21"/>occaſion of diſcomfort. But all the comforts in the world will vaniſh that have not ſome firme foundation when they are ſtruck at, and when ſome tempeſt beats againſt them, to caſt them downe. And therefore it is good to bee eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in every truth wherein comfort may be received.</p>
               <p>Now, from this paſſage, as it hath reference to the coherence, I may obſerve unto you, that, When ever the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is ſet up in freſhneſſe, and glory, and beauty, he doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes meet with ſtrong oppoſition: I ſay, the Lord Chriſt, that righteous Man, was never raiſed up, but a ſtorme was raiſed with him; there is an everlaſting fighting againſt the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious light of Chriſts Goſpel, when ever it breakes out. You may ſee the truth of this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, eſpecially ſince Chriſts perſonall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all times; no ſooner did the Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to preach Chriſt, as raiſed from the dead, but a madneſſe and a fury grew upon thoſe that thought themſelves in authority, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees;</hi> their ſwords were preſently drawn, their priſons ſet open to clap up thoſe that preached Chriſt; <hi>Herod</hi> killed one, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned another, intending to kill him too. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved I need ſay little of this, your owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may now be a ſufficient witneſſe of that which, perhaps, you feared long before. Now
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:175622:21"/>is come the time of reformation, and purging of the Church, the time is come of ſetting up the Ark, and bringing <hi>Dagon</hi> down: you ſee the fruit of this, you ſee what combuſtions this hath raiſed in the world: let Chriſt himſelf be never ſo peaceable, yet when he comes, men will picke a quarrell with him; therefore by the way, as it is a truth in generall, ſo is it in particular caſes too: When ever we the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, devote our ſelves only to ſet up Chriſt, and labour might and maine upon this worke, we muſt expect to have the world about our cares. And for you, beloved, if you dreame of peace and reſt in the world, if you dreame of finding of friendſhip and amity, and applauſe with men, while you endeavour to ſet up the Lord Chriſt, you miſtake your ſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. You muſt looke for uproars, and tumults, and clamours from the world, and there will be theſe continually attending you.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, from the coherence, you may obſerve, As mad and deſperate as the world is, and the enemies of Chriſt are in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and making oppoſition againſt Chriſt; yet no weapons formed in this kinde ſhall proſper. <hi>The Lord hath raiſed him up,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>and he ſhall rule over the Heathen, and they ſhall bee as duſt before his ſword, and as driven ſtubble before his bow.</hi> I ſay, this ſhall come to paſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:175622:22"/>it is no great matter how majeſtically the world lookes, and how mighty it makes it ſelfe, for, beloved, if all the World ſhould combine againſt one perſon, that ſtands for the cauſe of Chriſt, rather than Chriſt ſhould ſinke, this perſon ſhould bee able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand even the whole World.

               <p>But this is not that I meane neither; I come therefore to the Text it ſelfe: The Text is a word of incouragement, or a word of hearten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, held forth to thoſe ſpirits that are ſubject to faint and droop, in reſpect of the affliction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that are likely, or at leaſt ſeeme to be likely to grow upon the Church of Chriſt; <hi>Feare not, be not diſmayed, I am thy God, I am with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the words, there are two generalls very remarkable and obſervable:</p>
               <p>Firſt, the temper of the ſpirit that the Lord
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:175622:22"/>aimes to reduce his people unto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the courſe the Lord takes to reduce them thereunto.</p>
               <p>The temper of ſpirit that the Lord deſires to reduce his people unto, is delivered in a double expreſſion; <hi>Feare not; bee not diſmayed.</hi> They are both one, ſaving that diſmayedneſſe is the higheſt extremity of feare; ſo then the temper that he endeavours to reduce them unto, is a quietneſſe, and ſettledneſſe, and undauntedneſſe of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the courſe that God takes to bring them to this temper of ſpirit, is a propoſall of motives and arguments of ſufficient effect, and prevalency to pull down vain feare out of the heart; <hi>Feare not, for I am thy God; I am with thee,</hi> and ſo forth. The reſult of the Text is briefly this: They need never to be affraid, nor diſmayed at any thing, though it appeare never ſo hideous, who have God for their God, and preſent with them, and a help unto them. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, theſe are times, as I hinted before unto you, that require ſuch a cordial as this, now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto you: For now in a more eminent way then ever before, is the glory of the Kingdome of Chriſt conteſted againſt, and attempted to be thrown down to the duſt. Now, when wee heare of evills, our hearts are ſubject to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, and eſpecially when wee ſee them with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:175622:23"/>our eyes; the ſword is drawne, nay, blood is drawne, the hearts of men are full of faintings, and many almoſt at their wits ends; many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſuſpect what will become of things, out of the fainting &amp; ſuſpicion of their ſpirits. And therefore now, now it is time to bring forth, out of the treaſures of the Lord, that, that may ſtay the ſpirits of the people of God; that is, ſuch an incouragement as the Lord himſelfe gives, which will be the beſt way in the world to eſtabliſh our hearts; namely, when God will ſay to a ſoule, <hi>Feare not, be not diſmayed; for I am thy God:</hi> it is a cup of conſolation indeed. And that wee may draw it forth to you, with the better advantage for you to drinke deepe of it, let us take theſe particulars into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</p>
               <p>Firſt, what it is, <hi>not to feare, nor to be diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, what it is, that wee muſt not <hi>feare</hi> and be <hi>diſmayed</hi> at.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what the fruite of <hi>fear,</hi> or <hi>diſmayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> is, or what prejudice or diſadvantage <hi>feare,</hi> or <hi>diſmayedneſſe</hi> brings along with them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee ſhall then conſider the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Lord, to take us off from theſe diſtempers of <hi>feare,</hi> and <hi>diſmayedneſſe;</hi> namely, becauſe God is our God; and in that wee ſhall conſider.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:175622:23"/>
               <p>Firſt, what it is for God to be thy God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſhall conſider, what ſtrength there is in this Argument, God being thy God, how this takes off fear and diſmayedneſſe. And,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing there is ſuch ſtrength in this Argument, we ſhall conſider how God doth become the God of perſons and people, that ſo you may ſee the way to enter into this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to have God for your God, and ſo to bee ſecured from fear and diſmayedneſſe.</p>
               <p>To begin with the firſt, what it is for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not to feare, nor be diſmayed. I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved concerning all the paſſions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, that the ſenſe of them far better open their nature, then any diſcourſe poſſibly can. When a fit of feare, eſpecially when the height of diſmayedneſſe it ſelfe ſeizes upon a ſpirit, that ſpirit may read a playner lecture to it ſelf of that Paſſion, then all the Rhetorick of men in the world can expreſſe; I mean, fear is ſuch a paſſion, as every one knowes better by thoſe experiments they have of it, what it is, then another is poſſible able to diſcribe. It is a very diſtracting, diſturbing, confounding paſſion; it is a kinde of beſotting paſſion, that makes men loſe themſelves, eſpecially, if it be in the extremity of feare, It ariſes from an apprehenſion of ſome unavoidable, inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table evill growing upon a perſon, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:175622:24"/>either by ſome ſymptomes of that evill, or by ſome meſſenger or other relating it, or by ſome foreſight of the evill in the eye. Now, as evill appears greater or leſſer, and more or leſſe tolerable, ſo the paſſion of feare, is more or leſſe in perſons. In brief, I will give you but a touch of the nature of this paſſion, and you ſhall have it delivered to you in the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> where he ſets it forth by its contrary, by what it is not to be afraid, or not to be diſmayed, in 112 <hi>Pſalme</hi> the 7. and 8. <hi>verſes,</hi> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> hath divers expreſſions, that plainly ſhew, what it is for a perſon not to bee affraid, <hi>Hee ſhall not bee moved,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>his heart is fixed, hee ſhall not be affraid; his heart is eſtabliſhed.</hi> Marke the phraſes, and in them you ſhall have a full Lecture read to you of a heart not affraid nor diſmayed. Firſt, it is a heart that is not moved nor ſtirred: ſuppoſe evill grows on, it may bee the ſword, the enemy appeares bigger and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; ſtill the dangers are greater and greater; what is it now not to be affraid? It is not to be moved at all at any time; ſo farre forth as the appearance of danger moves the heart, or turnes it, ſo farre hee is affraid. So the other phraſe doth import, <hi>His heart is fixed.</hi> You know, that feare in the heart, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes expreſſed by the ſhaking and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of it; and therefore the Holy Ghoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:175622:24"/>it alſo by the ſhaking of the tops of trees, ſo it cauſeth an unſtedfaſtneſſe of ſpirit. Now ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>they ſhall not be affraid, whoſe hearts are fixed,</hi> that is, as a poſt that is ſet deep in the ground, and rammed in, ſtands faſt, ſo that if you thruſt againſt it, it ſtirs not, it is fixed: ſo when any thing beats againſt the heart to ſhake it, and to overthrow it, when the heart of a man ſtirs not at it, it is a fixed heart, and is not affraid. And ſo the phraſe that followes; <hi>his heart is eſtabliſhed,</hi> ſignifieth that it is made a ſtable and firm heart, ſo that it cannot bee ſhaken. In briefe, to have a heart not affraid nor diſmayed, is to have a heart calm, that lookes with a regardleſſe eye, as I may ſay, upon evills when they doe grow out. You ſhall ſee beloved, this affection or temper of ſpirit, <hi>not to be affraid,</hi> in that ſenſe I mention, excellently deſcribed unto you in the third of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the 16. <hi>verſe,</hi> and there, when ever you would know whether you be affraid or no you ſhall find alwayes as in a Lecture, the thing diſcovered unto you. You know what danger was in the eies of thoſe three children, <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach</hi> and <hi>Abednigo,</hi> there was a hot fiery furnace prepared for them, ſeven times hotter than ordinary; the King proclaimes that what ever he be that will not fall down and worſhip his Image, ſhould preſently be caſt into this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:175622:25"/>This was enough to ſtartle a perſon, and make him tremble. But how is the temper of the three children expreſſed there? <hi>We are not,</hi> ſay they, <hi>carefull to anſwer thee in this matter.</hi> Theſe threatnings, though very fearfull in the eyes of others, ſeemed but a matter of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them, they made a tuſh at it, <hi>We are not carefull to anſwer thee in this matter.</hi> Even ſo people are then free from feare, who when evill is comming, care not for it; a man when he cares not for any thing that aſſailes him, hee ruſheth in upon it, and although it ſeeme to threaten unto him ſome miſchief, yet he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident it cannot hurt him. So far forth as you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> can overlook evills drawing on upon you, more or leſſe, not regarding them, in reſpect of any hurt they can doe you, ſo far forth are you free from feare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, none in the world can have ſuch a temper of ſpirit, when dangers are growing, eſpecially great and thick upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: What ſay you of theſe three children? I ſpeak of men now, they were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, it may be, that was an extraordinary caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay, you ſhall finde, that the very ground of the undauntedneſſe of their ſpirits was the ſame which the Lord propoſeth in this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:175622:25"/>Text, to put us out of feare. <hi>We are careleſſe to anſwer thee in this matter.</hi> Why? <hi>Our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us, and he will deliver us.</hi> The careleſneſſe of their ſpirits was grounded upon a common principle of the whole Church, and upon the ſame, the Lord propoſeth to all the reſt of his people, as well as to them; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confident God was their God, neither the greatneſſe of the King, nor the violence of his threatnings, could ſtir them a jot, they were all nothing to God, who was their God, who was able to deliver them, and would deliver them. Their confidence in this, was that which made them break forth into this bold expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>We are careleſſe to anſwer thee in this matter.</hi> But now let us conſider, what the people of God ſhould not feare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> What, to be affraid of nothing? doth not the Lord himſelfe commend feare to men? Nay, is not God himſelfe called <hi>the fear of Iſaac?</hi> and yet would you make us to believe, that we ſhould have no fear?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, there is a threefold feare; here is a naturall feare, a religious feare; and here is a turbulent feare: A naturall feare is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:175622:27"/>As much as to ſay, Indeed, till a man looke to Chriſt, there is nothing but matter of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and evill to be ſeen as the certain fruits of ſin, and there can be nothing but bitterneſſe in ſin, in regard of the evill that is like to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. But when perſons can once looke to Chriſt, the caſe is altered. What doth he thanke God for? He thanks God, that though natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a body of death grew up by ſin; yet there is no prejudice in this kinde can come to him, through Chriſt. Now, that the Apoſtle doth plainly mean, that he thanks God, in that ſin could not doe him, or others any hurt: mark how in his thankfulneſſe he expreſſeth himſelf in the beginning of the 8.

No, you will ſay no condemnation in Hell, but yet, as there is remainders of ſinne in Gods owne people, ſo there will ſome evill or other fall upon the commiſſion of ſin; marke what the Apoſtle ſpeakes of it in the 2. and 4. ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:175622:28"/>could not doe, in that it was weake through the fleſh, God ſent forth his Son in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh. The Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt, hath freed mee from the Law of ſinne, and death.</hi> Here Chriſt ſtands for the deliverance of his people from condemnation, from eternall wrath, ſay ſome; yea, but ſaith the Apoſtle, wee are delivered from the Law of ſin and death; what is the Law of ſin, but what the Law may do to perſons, for thoſe ſins which are committed by them? Now what can ſin do when it is condemned? It is true, take a Traytor, as he is at liberty, hee may do miſchief, but take him as he is arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and condemned, and as he is bound and manacled, he can doe no hurt. Now ſinne is condemned to the Believer, it can do no hurt at all to him; for what hurt can that doe unto a man which is carried into a Land of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, to avoid further prejudice of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are indangered by it? When men have been found dangerous unto the State, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:175622:28"/>further; ſuppoſe a man be entered into many bonds, and they are for great ſummes; It is true, while they remaine bonds in force, ſuch a man is ſubject to feare arreſts; but put the caſe theſe bonds are all cancelled, that the debt in the Creditors book be blotted out, what hurt then can theſe bonds do unto a man, when the ſeal is torn off, and all the writing in the bond is blotted out? If a man ſaw a thouſand ſuch bonds, in which he were obliged, it would affright him no more then if he ſaw none at all. True indeed, every ſin is a great debt, and wee commit ſins daily and hourly againſt the Lord, and the torments of Hel is the merit of the leaſt ſin in the world; for, I ſpeake not this to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate any ſin, but to ſhew the greatnes of Gods Grace, and to eaſe, upon good grounds, diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed conſciences. Therefore, ſuch as look upon theſe ſins, as uncancelled, and theſe debts, as true debts; it is true, ſo long theſe ſins may work a horror and trembling in perſons, but for Believers that are the members of Chriſt, they may read fairly all the ſins that ever they have committed, they may read alſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of theſe tranſgreſſions, which ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted and inflicted upon them, if they were not cancelled and blotted out. But marke what the Lord ſpeaks, in the 43. of <hi>Iſaiah, I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions, for mine owne
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:175622:29"/>name ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> Now, what prejudice can that do, that is blotted out? I ſay, every debt of a Believer is a cancelled debt, ſo that the Lord himſelfe hath nothing at all to lay to a Believers charge: For, how can that Scorpion do hurt, that hath loſt his ſting, and ſpent his venome in the ſides of Chriſt, and left it there? <hi>It was Chriſt that was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the tranſgreſſions of his people, he was bruiſed for the iniquities of the faithfull, the chaſtiſements of their peace was upon him,</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, in the 53. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the 5. verſe. What hurt can there be to whom there is peace from God, and nothing but peace? It is true, our ſins themſelves do not ſpeak peace, but Chriſt bearing the ſinne and the wrath that theſe ſins doe deſerve, his chaſtiſement, or the wrath hee ſuſtained, ſpeaks peace to every Believer, whoſe tranſgreſſions be did beare. Therefore, beloved, be not affraid, ye that are Believers, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, for fear of wrath breaking down from heaven upon you for ſuch and ſuch ſins, which you have committed, for they can do you no hurt, all your ſins together can do you no harme, all the ſting and poyſon of your ſins were ſpent upon the backe of Chriſt. Marke that excellent expreſſion of the Apoſtle in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56, 57. he tels us there indeed, <hi>that the ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſinne is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:175622:29"/>the Law;</hi> ſo that here ſeems to be a ſting in ſin even to death it ſelfe. But mark what follows, <hi>thanks be to God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt., that hath given us the victory.</hi> What doth he meane? even the victory of overcoming of ſinne, and death, that is his true meaning. Though natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſin hath a ſting, yet there is a victory over this ſting. Chriſt is the death of it, as he tooke away the ſting of it, ſo that the ſins of Believers ſet up to affright them by Satan, or his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they are but Scare-crows and Bugbears, things to fright ignorant children indeed, but men of inſight and underſtanding, are able to ſee that they are counterfeit things. It is true, before men come to ſee the light of the Goſpel of Chriſt, their ſins ſtare in their faces, ſeeming to ſpit fire at them: but juſt as you ſhall have children, it may be, put one of their company into hideous poſtures, and a fearfull and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible repreſentation, cauſing every one that knowes it not, to run from him: ſo ſinne, as it is ſet up by Satan with a terrible viſage, as it were to ſpit fire in the faces of the godly, and faithfull, ſeems very threatning and dreadfull. But they are to know for certaine, it is but a made thing, there is no feare from the ſins of Believers, all the terror and fearfulneſſe of ſin Chriſt himſelfe hath drunk it, and in the drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, Chriſt himſelfe our life, was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:175622:30"/>and in that regard, I ſay, all the terror and gaſtlineſſe, and hideouſneſſe of ſin, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by Satan, is ſpent, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n it ſelf is dead. It is true, indeed a living roaring Lion is a terrible creature, but in a dead Lion there is no more feare then is in a ſtick, or a ſtone, to him that knows he is dead. While ſin is alive, it is fearfull and corrible, and deadly; but when ſin it ſelf is dead, then there is no more terror in it then is in a dead Lion.</p>
               <p>Thus I ſpeak concerning ſin, not as it ſmiles upon a man, with a promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed, terrible it ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the Apoſtle telling us of the <hi>Hand-writing of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances that was againſt us, and contrary to us,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt hath nailed them to his Croſſe.</hi> So that the ſins of Believers are crucified with Chriſt; <hi>they that are Chriſts, have crucified, the fleſh, with the affections, and luſts thereof.</hi> We
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:175622:30"/>commonly underſtand this, as if our mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and denying of ſin, were the crucifying of the fleſh: but the Apoſtle ſpeaks otherwiſe there, and you may ſee, he intends, that they that are Chriſt are crucified with him, as much as to ſay, Chriſts dying upon the croſſe for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, his death became the death, that is, the expiation of ſin for them, that it ſhould be no more terrible unto them, nor affright the people of God. I have in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſted the more upon this, becauſe indeed, it is the root from whence all other feares ſpring: For, from croſſes and afflictions, which come upon perſons (of which we ſhall ſpeake preſently) they run immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their ſins, and conceive that it is their ſins that have put ſtings into them, and makes them ſo bitter; ſtill therefore they are perplexed with fears, as long as ſin is upon them; Certainly, ſome fearfull thing wil come upon them, Why? they have committed ſuch and ſuch ſins, theſe be the cauſe of their fear. But beloved, either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plainly that Chriſt dyed for your ſins, and that he hath borne the whole wrath of God, that ſin hath deſerved, or ſit down by this truth that ſin did hurt Chriſt ſo much, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt the Believer for whom Chriſt did die.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as we ſhould not fear our own ſins, being Believers, and members of Chriſt; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought we to fear the ſins of others.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:175622:31"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, ſuppoſing there be no ſins of our own to pull downe judgement, yet the world is full of iniquity, and abundance of ſins there are upon the times that bring downe wrath from Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though it be true, that Nationall ſins bring downe Nationall judgements and wrath; yet all the ſins of the times cannot do a member of Chriſt a lot of hurt. And therefore, as they cannot do him any hurt, ſo he need not be affraid of them. I will make it appeare, that the ſins of the world, the crying ſins of the times, can do a Believer no hurt at all: Marke the plea of the Lord, often mentioned in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> againſt the people that hit him in the teeth, as if he were unjuſt, <hi>The fathers</hi> ſay they, <hi>have eaten ſowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge.</hi> He pleads his owne innocency in it, and directly anſwers, that <hi>the ſoule that ſinneth ſhall dye;</hi> As much as to ſay, he that doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the fault, ſhall bear the burthen of it; thou that art not the committer of the fault, thou ſhalt not bear the burthen of it. Therefore the ſins of the times that are committed by the wicked, they cannot do Gods people any hurt. The childrens teeth ſhall not be ſet on edge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> I, but, ſome will ſay, I have had ſome hand in theſe ſins, I did not reprove theſe ſins, or, I did not ſeperate my ſelfe from them.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:175622:31"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, ſuppoſe that the members of Chriſt are in ſome ſort acceſſary to theſe ſins yet, ſo far as you in your owne perſons, have been actors, or partakers of theſe tranſgreſſions, Chriſt hath borne theſe tranſgreſſions, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for them. It is not ſome ſins that Chriſt bears, and leaves ſome ſins for Believers to bear, and ſo alſo leaves ſome puniſhment for Believers to ſuffer; for it is the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world; and that he doth take them all away, appeareth, 1 John 1.7. <hi>The blood of Christ his Sonne, cleanſeth us from all ſins.</hi> Whether then you conſider every elect perſon, as he ſinneth by himſelfe, or as he ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with others, all theſe ſinnes the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth him from; and therefore, I ſay, the ſins of other people, they ſhall not, they cannot be imputed to him that is a Believer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But, you will ſay, ſurely the Lord doth ſend croſſes and afflictions upon his owne people, as well as upon the people of the world many times, and ſhould we not therefore bee affraid of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Therefore in the third place, let mee tell you, as there is no occaſion nor need; nay, as people ought not to be affraid for the ſins of others, ſo ought not they to be affraid for the chaſtiſements of the Lord upon them. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but the true nature of feare, looke upon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:175622:32"/>things as they are in themſelves. If there bee occaſion of feare in any thing that may come, there muſt be evill in theſe afflictions, or elſe there need not be feare: now there is no evill in them, but all are exceeding good, and they work for good, and that that works for good, is not evill; every agent produceth effects an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to its owne nature: an evill tree brings forth no good fruit, no more doth a good tree bring forth evill fruit; ſo then, if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but good in all the afflictions of the people of God, then there is no cauſe of feare, there is an apprehenſion of evill in a thing, if there be feare, but there is not a juſt apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of evill in a thing that is good; be aſſured of this, there is no feare to be had of afflictions, let them be never ſo tart, let them be never ſo great or many. Oh, ſaith one, I ſhall be undone, as others are, that are plundered, here the heart is diſturbed and diſtracted. But beloved, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you loſe all that you have, even the wife out of your boſomes, and your children out of your arms, &amp; ſo you be deprived of all, yet there is no evill in them, and therefore you ought not to be affraid. There is nothing but good a them: the Apoſtle in the 12. <hi>Hebr.</hi> tells us, that it is true, <hi>for the preſent, no affliction ſeems joyous, but grievous;</hi> yet he takes away all occaſions of feare, though for the preſent they ſeem evill, <hi>yet
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:175622:32"/>afterwards,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they bring forth the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſſe to thoſe that are exerciſed therewith.</hi> What hurt is in them, when they bring forth the peaceable fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? In afflictions, they are refined as Silver, and as Gold. What hurt is there to Silver in the fire, when nothing is intended but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the droſſe from the Silver? When the Lord afflicts his people, he ſits as a Refiner to take away the droſſe. The afflictions of Gods people are nothing but the refinings of God, to take away the ruſt. What hurt is there in Phyſick, eſpecially in good phyſick, when the body is diſtempered? They that know the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it, will they be affraid of it, though it make them ſicke for a time? It is true, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſuſpition of the operation will make men affraid, but the Lord hath made it known to us, that all his chaſtiſements are the fruits of his love, and this is the end of all, to take away their ſins. It is true, men need not feare that the ſins they commit ſhall do them hurt, but the Lord makes uſe of afflictions, to purge out ſin from the converſation, where it is a trouble and burthen, both to the faithfull and Brethren, though hee doth not revenge himſelfe of any before committed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as wee ought not to be affraid of ſin and afflictions in generall, ſo for the preſent

In the 120. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> you ſhall ſee that there is no cauſe to feare, though there bee never ſo much evill approaching. This <hi>Pſalme</hi> was made of purpoſe, to ſet forth this thing, that the godly need not feare the fury of the oppreſſor: <hi>If the Lord had not been on our</hi> ſide <hi>when men roſe up againſt us, they had ſwallowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:175622:33"/>been on their ſide, they had been ſwallowed up quick; and if ſo be the Lord be on our ſide, what need of fear is there at all of their wrath? The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, that <hi>ſurely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee, and the remainder of wrath thou ſhalt reſtrain,</hi> Pſal. 76.10. See what little cauſe, there is of fear from the wrath and rage of men there ſhall nothing but matter of praiſe come forth to the Lord out of it. Wilt thou be afraid of that by which the Lord ſhall bee praiſed? The Lord is praiſed by the wrath of men, and all the ſuperfluity of wrath, all that is over and above, more then is for the glory of God, the Lord will reſtraine that, <hi>The wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee, and the remainder of wrath thou ſhalt reſtraine.</hi> The wrath that is more then for his praiſe, the Lord will be ſure to keep it in, and the wrath that is for the glory of God, wilt thou be afraid of it?</p>
               <p>Moreover, as you ought not to feare the wrath of men, ſo you ought not to fear the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of the enemies of God. Though hell it ſelf combine with them, to lay ſnares to entrap the people of God, there is no cauſe of fear of them; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:175622:34"/>counſell of the prudent, where is the Wiſeman where is the Scribe? Where is the Diſputer of this world? He hath choſen the fooliſh things of this world to confound the wiſe, as well as the weak things of the world to confound the ſtrong. Now, if the Lord chooſe fooliſh things to confound the wiſe, or the wiſe things of the world to confound themſelves; why oughteſs thou to be affraid?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is no occaſion of fear (to them that have God for their God) of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of cruelty.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But marke what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Our life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> It is true, there is a naturall life, and that life may be deſtroyed as well as the life of a wicked man, but yet the ſoule of a Believer is not deſtroyed, the ſoul is cannon-proof, all the devills in hell cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it; <hi>The life that I now live, I live by the faith of the Some of God; Chriſt himſelfe is our life. Now, when Chriſt, who is our life, ſhall appeare, then ſhall wee appeare with him in glory.</hi> So that Chriſt himſelfe may be killed before our lives ſhall bee deſtroyed by the enemies. You that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:175622:35"/>are Believers have this advantage of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the unbelievers, you may take away their lives, but they cannot take away your lives. They have but one life, a naturall life, but they that are Believers, have a life in Chriſt; nay, Chriſt is their life, he himſelf ſhall be annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before they ſhal. All the power of the ſword cannot take away that life from you; it is true, they may take you out of this world, and the comforts of it; but know, this world, when the Lord will have the ſoule ſeparated from it, is a comfortleſſe world. If the Lord himſelf ſhould anſwer a perſon to give him life in the world, when himſelf hath purpoſed to take him out of the world, the world and life it ſelf would be a hell to him. Beloved, know this, that the Lord intends only your good in all your changes, and that which is beſt, the Lord provides for you. Though your life be taken away from you, where is the loſſe? where is the hurt? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it well, beloved, death is but the opening of the priſon doors, to let you out of priſon; it is but the arriving of a veſſell into the haven of reſt. What doth the ſword do when it enters into a Believer? it makes but a change of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality for mortality, of life for death, of ſtrength for weakneſſe, of glory for ſhame, of holineſſe for ſin. It doth but pull down a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten houſe of clay, to give poſſeſſion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:175622:35"/>of glory. It doth but take perſons from a cottage at will, to enter into a Lordſhip of inheritance: for it gives full poſſeſſion of an eternall inheritance. The ſword, that enters into the breaſt of a Believer, it doth but put him into the chamber of the Bridegroome, and conſummates the marriage of the Lamb to that perſon. It is the fulfilling of the great cry of the Saints, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly:</hi> and, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt:</hi> It takes the Bride into communion, and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with her long-looked for Beloved, and gives her poſſeſſion of thoſe things that take up her longing. While we are in the fleſh, we are abſent from the Lord; we enjoy the viſion of Chriſt now but in hope, and we enjoy it but darkly: but when <hi>this earthly tabernacle ſhall bee diſſolved, we have an houſe not made with hands;</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. It doth but carry the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of a barren, bluſtering, troubleſome wilderneſſe, unto his home, to ſit downe with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the Kingdome of glory. What hurt is there in all this? Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, that when the worſt comes to the worſt, if ye ſhould be brought into the greateſt ſtrait that ever man was in, when cruelty ſhall rage and ſwell to the very top, and to its utmoſt bounds. This is that which ſtayes up the heart, and makes the weakeſt ſpirits ſtrong; and the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:175622:36"/>want of this, makes the ſtrongeſt run away. When a man ſhall thinke with himſelfe, if I ſhould be now thruſt through by the ſword of the enemy, what will become of me? If I be not a member of Chriſt, I ſhall go to Hell for ever. Oh, how will this ſtartle him. This in the heart of the ſtouteſt ſouldier, is enough to make him run away, have he never ſo much courage; but when a man ſhall ſtand in the face of an enemy, and the bullets flye about him on every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ide; if when he ſhall thus think with himſelf, What if one of theſe ſhould hit me, what ſhall become of me? whither ſhould I goe? If he can but ſay in true faith, Heaven is mine, and Chriſt is mine, I ſhall goe preſently unto God my Father, at whoſe right hand are ioyes for evermore; I cannot have a better turne done unto me, then by one of theſe meſſengers, to be ſent preſently thither. It is recorded, that there was a man had a ſpear run at him, by one that ſought his life, and entring, it happened to lance an ulcer, that all the Phyſitians could never cure; that thruſt of the ſpear, cured the ulcer. Oh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, all the world is not able to cure the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that are in Believers, in reſpect of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation and practice of ſin; for ſin will ariſe, and breake forth in ſpite of all the world, and they ſhall not ceaſe to ſin, till they ſhall ceaſe to be here below: Now the ſword that enters
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:175622:36"/>into the hearts of the Believers, and members of Chriſt, that ſword at one thruſt perfectly cures all the ulcers of ſinfulneſſe, that there ſhall never ariſe any more after that: Now what hurt is there in that ſpear, that cures in ſtead of killing?</p>
               <p>This, beloved, I ſpeake by way of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to all the faithfull; when the enemy looks big upon you, and your hearts are ready to faint, conſider what the Lord ſaith, <hi>I am your God, be not affraid, nor diſmayed:</hi> Sometimes I obſerve people looke upon Believers with an evill eye, becauſe they doe not ſee them of ſuch dejected countenances, and ſo full of fearful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as are in themſelves, or are in others: Thereupon they preſently cenſure them to bee ſuch as are void of ſenſe, and full of ſecurity. But conſider, hath not the Lord promiſed, that they ſhall not be moved with evill tydings? Is there nothing in all the promiſes of God? Will you ſay there is no ſtrength, nor truth in him, in whom is the fulneſſe of all, that when you finde ſuch an undauntedneſſe of ſpirit in any man, that when men ſpeake of fire and ſword, and the cruelty of the enemy, ſhall ſay, we are careleſſe, as touching this matter, you ſhall ſay they are ſtupified, or carnally ſecure? Do you not therein charge the three children for the ſame? Shall the people of God, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They know: wherein pain is, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is, and death is, which thou art not ſenſible of. Do not then condemn God therefore. Is thine eye evill, becauſe Gods is good?</p>
               <p>Now, what are the diſadvantages by this diſmayedneſſe of ſpirit? there are three ſorts of them:</p>
               <p>Firſt, fearfulneſſe and diſmayedneſſe of ſpirit doth produce a great deal of prejudice unto God, not ſimply to the being of God, but to the glory and honour of God; fearfulneſſe and diſmayedneſſe, caſt many ſlanders upon him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Slanders upon his power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Slanders upon his faithfulneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Slanders upon his care and providence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Slanders upon the freeneſſe of his grace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Slanders upon the efficacy of the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To touch of theſe a little, which by the grace of God, may quit your hearts of theſe feares.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it caſts a ſlander upon the power of God: If you lend a man an hundred pounds, and he give you a bond to pay it you againe, it may be you feare you ſhall not have it againe; What is the ground of it? I doubt, ſay you,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:175622:37"/>he will not be able to pay me. When fear ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from ſuch a Principle, now doth not this caſt an aſperſion upon the ability and ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the man? If you did think he were an able man indeed, you would not ſuſpect him: ſo when you ſee ſuch and ſuch evills growing towards you, and you begin to be afraid, and to cry out, Doubtleſſe, I ſhall ſink under them, God is not able to deliver me, at ſuch a time; I ſay, Unbelief of the power of God being the occaſion of ſuch fear, it thereby caſts an heavy ſlander upon God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, I did never doubt of the ability of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you doe not, yet <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, <hi>Can God,</hi> ſay they, <hi>give fleſh in the wilderneſſe?</hi> And conſider with your ſelves how often it hath been in the hearts of people, when they have been in any great extremity; How ſhall we eſcape? there is no poſſibility for us to avoid this evill. Is not this now a calling in queſtion the power of God, in ſuch fears as theſe are: If ſo, then is there a great ſcandall caſt upon the power of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it likewiſe brings a ſcandall to the faithfulneſſe and truth of God. Some will ſay, I do not queſtion whether God can do this, but all my fear is, whether he will doe it or no. This fear ariſeth from hence; there is a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:175622:38"/>that God will not do it. Now, I ask this queſtion, Hath God ſaid he will doe it? Hath he ſaid, <hi>I will never faile thee, nor forſake thee?</hi> Hath he ſaid, that all things ſhall worke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for our good? Hath he ſaid it? and doe you feare he will not do it? What do you make of God? Is not God as good as his word? Is God and his faithfulneſſe out of credit with you? Hath God ſaid, and will he not perform? If a man hath promiſed to give you a hundred pound, and when he is gone, you fear you ſhall never have it, doe you not call in que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Thirdly, you charge the providence and care of God; you know what God hath ſaid, <hi>Be carefull for nothing, but in all things make your requeſts knowne to him;</hi> and bids <hi>caſt your care upon him, for he careth for you;</hi> doe you thinke God is mindfull of you, and cares for you when extremity of danger comes upon you, and you feare you ſhall miſcarry in ſuch a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, either you muſt thinke that he doth not

When thou art thus afraid thy fear is that ſuch an evill will overtake thee, and withall, thou lookeſt upon thy deſerts, and thou ſayſt this may well come upon me, I have deſerved it; I have committed ſuch and ſuch ſins, and they will certainly provoke the Lord to ſend all theſe evills I feare upon me; becauſe thou haſt ſinned, thou doſt feare ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will come upon thee, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:175622:39"/>
               <p>The ſecond prejudice of feare is, as it reſpects Gods ſervice; it may appeare divers wayes to you:</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſo far forth as fear poſſeſſes the heart, ſo far forth is faith ſuppreſſed; this fear is the cut-throat of believing; In quietneſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, ſhall be your reſt; where there is reſt, there is confidence, and where there is no reſt, there can be no conſidence; there fore as far as you fear the afflictions of the world, in reſpect of your ſins, ſo far are you weak in faith; Faith makes men ſit downe ſatisfied and ſetled in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereas fear fills men full of queſtioning and doubtings of things: when things are dark, and not clear, there are diſputings, but faith, that puts an end to all doubts and fears; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo long as there is fear, there is unbelief.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>diſmayedneſſe</hi> is prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to all religious duties: firſt, it is a damper of prayer; Beloved, you know, that the life of prayer lies in faith, <hi>If any man pray, let him aske in faith,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> Faith is the wing of prayer, and carries it up to heaven; clip the wings of prayer, and the motions of it muſt be ſlow. Beloved, you that are afraid, doth feal and diſmayedneſſe take hold of your ſpirits? marke in ſuch a fit, what hearts you have to pray. In brief, there is this great prejudice in fear, it makes all the duties that perſons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:175622:40"/>meerly ſelfiſh. You know that a ſervant is very diligent for his maſter, when no danger cometh, but let the ſervant be in fear of any danger, he will leave his maſters buſineſſe to ſhift for himſelfe, and ſeek for his own ſafety: So conſider it well, whether your hearts are not for your ſelves in your ſervices, when there is a ſtrong paſſion of feare in your ſpirits: when a man is in prayer againſt ſome evill he fears is approaching unto him, what prayer is it? He is altogether for himſelfe, that he may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from his preſent feare; there is not a thought (ſo far as this fear prevails) that God may be glorified all the while, but only of the evill that is upon him, or that is like to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him whereas the Believer ſhould ſerve with ſincerity and ſingleneſſe of ſpirit; he ſhould do that which he doth as unto the Lord, (ſaith the Apoſtle) Do not miſtake, it is not the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualneſſe, nor the fervency in the performance of duties that carries it; duties are not expiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry helpers with Chriſt: But, I ſay, when duties are performed as to the Lord, and for the Lord, and not to, and for himſelf, then are they right as ſervices. But all our hope that we muſt have in any condition, muſt be only from the grace of God, and all our performances that we do act, muſt be to the Lord for what he hath done for us. Therefore, ſeeing it is the Lord himſelf
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:175622:40"/>that calls upon you, and claps you on the back, and bids you be not affraid, take courage from the Lord, and quit your ſelves like men. In danger be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might: There is this difference between Gods call and mans call, to do any thing; men call men to ſervices and employments, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give them power &amp; ability to perform that which they are called unto; but God calls and gives influence of his owne to make men doe ſuch things as he calls them unto. The Lord ſaith, Feare not, and in the voyce of the Lord there is life, to frame the ſame temper in your hearts. Chriſt, he ſhall ſtand over your dead hearts as he did over the dead body of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Lazarus, ariſe,</hi> who immediatly aroſe: the word of his mouth carried life into it, and with it: So it ſaith, <hi>Fear not,</hi> and immediately it takes away all feare from the ſpirit of that man he ſpeaks inwardly unto; other men may ſpeak, and ſpeak their hearts out, and never the better, but when God calls upon you not to be afraid, he is preſent in his Ordinances, meerly for his owne ſake, to hold out this undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit to you, it is now with you if you imbrace it: it is at your dores, he wil make you of a ſtrong and undaunted ſpirit, he ſhal ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then you as that <hi>Leviathan</hi> the Lord ſpeakes of in the 41. of <hi>Job,</hi> which eſteemed Iron as ſtraw,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:175622:41"/>and braſſe as rotten wood, becauſe his ſcales were ſo ſtrong: know this, that Believers are the <hi>Leviathans</hi> of God, hee will ſo ſteel their ſpirits, that they ſhall cut Iron as ſtraw, and Braſſe as rotten wood. The Lord is able to put ſuch a ſpirit into you, and he will make good his promiſe, wherein he hath ingaged himſelfe, that his ſtrength ſhall be made perfect in weakneſſe; therefore, though you have ſaid, My ſtrength faileth me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In a word, there are a few civill reſpects that I will mention as motives againſt this fear, I will but touch them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, know, fear, eſpecially diſmayedneſſe, puts a man beſides his wits, that while he is in ſuch a paſſion, he is to ſeek for common wayes of ſafety; ſo that whereas men thinke that fear will h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:175622:41"/>Beſides, this fear is ſuch a rack and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that commonly thoſe evills ſo much fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, prove not ſo hurtfull nor evill to a perſon as the preſent fears; and beſides this, feare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, it doth not only daunt the ſpirit of a man in himſelf, but proves very dangerous to others: you already have had ſufficient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience not long ſince, of the evill and miſchieſe this fear had like to have occaſioned in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, a thouſand to one it was, that the fear of ſome had not made all the reſt to flye; and it was a miracle of mercy, that there ſhould be ſo great a feare in the Army, and the Army yet ſtand ſo to it; feare at ſuch a time, is of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſpreading and dangerous nature; fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in one, kindles fearfulneſſe in many, and ſo not only mens perſons, but alſo the Cauſe it ſelfe is hazarded, but theſe are but low things in reſpect of the prejudice God himſelfe ſuſtains in the feare of men; therefore, for your encouragement, conſider what the Lord hath in ſtore for you, nothing he hath, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he is, or can give, doth he think too good for you, but he is willing to part with it to make you happy; he parts not with his goods, but with his Son for you; nay, beloved, he parts with that which is more, if any thing can be more then his Son, that is, himſelfe: Will you now deprive your ſelves of the ſweet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the like occaſion that is now offered unto us, I have (perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, in the hearing of ſome preſent) made entrance into theſe words I have read now unto you; I ſhall give you but a taſte of what I have formerly ſpoken, ſo much as may ſerve by way of introduction to that, in which I mean to ſpend the remainder of this time.</p>
               <p>The occaſion of theſe words, you may ſee in the former paſſage of this Chapter. At this preſent inſtant, a great tumult and uproar was raiſed, upon the raiſing of the righteous Man, from the Eaſt, that is, the ſetting up of Chriſt: Such a noyſe there was, that God was fain to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:175622:43"/>call for ſilence, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. and for their plea, at the latter end of the verſe. If they have any thing to ſay againſt this buſineſſe of ſetting up of Chriſt, let them bring their ſtrongeſt reaſons, (ſaith the Lord.) Having thus obtained ſilence, the Lord makes his plea againſt their tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oppoſition, verſ. 2. <hi>Who is he that hath raiſed him up, and hath given Nations to him, and made him to rule over Kings? I the Lord did it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. What have you to ſay to me? He ſhall proſper, and he ſhall proſper with facility, and eaſe, he ſhall go ſoftly, he ſhall never run for fear of being circumvented; <hi>Hee ſhall go in a way that his foot hath not trode before,</hi> he ſhall go further then he hath gone; and what ſay they to this, when God ſpeaks? Yet the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men will not be quiet, they lay their heads together, as you finde, they conſult to finde out helpe: nay they conſpire, the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter</hi> and the <hi>Smith</hi> have laid their heads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Now, becauſe there is ſuch a combuſtion when Chriſt is ſet up, leſt the people of the Lord ſhould be poſſeſſed with diſmayedneſſe and feare of miſcarriage, the Lord turnes his ſpeech to theſe oppoſed: <hi>Fear not, I am with thee, be not diſmayed, I am thy God.</hi> Chriſt, when ever he is exalted, did, doth, and will, finde great oppoſition, but in ſpite of all oppoſition
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:175622:43"/>Chriſts exaltation ſhall proſper, all their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſhal not hinder; nay, he wil go ſoftly, that the world may ſee that he is not afraid of all oppoſition whatſoever. Firſt, in this Text, the Lord is pleaſed to provide a pillow, as for a King, for the heads of his people, or a ſtaffe for their trembling hand: a pillow to ſupport their ſinking ſpirits they are apt to be diſcouraged, it ſeems the Lord is pleaſed to take their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into his hand, to ſpeak to the occaſion of their trembling, and to give out ſuch words that may be a ſtay, that they may ſtand faſt, though bluſtrings grow greater then they are.</p>
               <p>The Textis nothing elſe but a gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, or a comfortable ſupport of a ſinking ſpirit. The incouragement is in theſe words; <hi>Fear not, be not diſmayed:</hi> the grounds and arguments by which he would prevaile with them not to fear, nor be diſmayed, are in theſe words: I <hi>am with thee; I am thy God; I will helpe thee; I will up hold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſſe.</hi> The point is this; That they that have God for their God, need never fear, nor be diſmayed, ſeeing this their God is with them, will helpe them, ſtrengthen them, and uphold them with the right hand of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Concerning this feare and diſmayedneſſe, we ſpake largely the laſt time we ſpake upon this occaſion.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:175622:44"/>
               <p n="1">1. What it is, not to be afraid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What we are not to be afraid of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What the inconveniences of ſuch feare are.</p>
               <p>In brief, not to feare, is no more but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſſe, and ſetledneſſe of ſpirit, againſt any evill that commeth Excellent is that expreſſion in the 112. <hi>Pſalme, verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>They ſhall not be afraid of evill tidings.</hi> What is that? <hi>Their heart is fixed,</hi> their heart is eſtabliſhed, they ſhall not be removed. Here is the expreſſion of a fearleſſe heart, a heart fixed, a heart eſtabliſhed, a heart not moved. You have it likewiſe excellently ſet out in <hi>Daniel</hi> 3. in an example, the 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> in the ſtory of the three children, being ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be caſt into the fiery furnace; they came before the great King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and hee ſpake big to them, and tells them what they muſt truſt unto, if they will not fall down and worſhip his Gods. Mark now, how their fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe and diſmayedneſſe is expreſſed: <hi>We are not carefull to anſwer thee in this matter, our God whom we ſerve, be will deliver us.</hi> See what a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition this fearleſneſſe is, and then what is the ground of it. <hi>We are not carefull to anſwer thee in this matter;</hi> here is a true fearleſneſſe if when ever evill comes, men can ſay, it matters not, we are ready for it: And look into the root of it, and you ſhall finde it in their anſwer; <hi>our
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:175622:44"/>God is able to deliver us,</hi> that made them ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in ſo weighty a thing; <hi>Our God whom wee ſerve, he will deliver us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, what it is we ſhould not fear. I anſwer, firſt, we ſhould not fear God himſelf, as to do us any hurt; fear him with awfull reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence we muſt A Believer that is the ſervant and choſen of God, need not fear that God will do him any hurt. <hi>It is God that juſtifieth,</hi> therefore it is not God that will harm thee. The heart of God is to his people; <hi>My bowells are troubled for thee,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Ephraim.</hi> Can he hurt them while he is troubled for them?</p>
               <p>Secondly, they muſt not fear their own ſins, I do not ſay, they ought not to fear to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſinne, but they ought not to feare what hurt their ſinnes can doe them, ſeeing they are blotted out. If a man have ſubſcribed unto, and ſealed a hundred Bonds, and all theſe Bonds be quite cancelled, and blotted out, he need not fear no hurt theſe Bonds can do him: <hi>Paul</hi> in the 7. of <hi>Rom.</hi> complaineth indeed of a body of death, and the power of ſin; but in the cloſure of the Chapter, he ſhews how little he fears any thing that ſin could doe: <hi>Thanks be unto God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> What doth he thank the Lord for? that though his firts were ſo great, yet they could not do him any hurt, nor any of Gods people. Look into
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:175622:45"/>the beginning of the 8. Chapter, it is plaine: <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt, who walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit: For the Law of the Spirit of life that is in Chriſt, hath freed me from the Law of ſin and death: For, what the Law could not do, in that it was weake through the fleſh, God ſending his owne Son in the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> What hurt can this do? Now, beloved, give me leave to tell you, if you be Believers, and weak in faith, I dare bee bold to ſay, nothing cuts the heart ſo much, in reſpect of fear of evill, as the ſins you do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: theſe will be ſwords to your hearts. But if you be Believers indeed, the ſword is broken, the ſting is gone; <hi>The ſting of death is ſinne, the ſtrength of ſinne is the Law,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>but thanks be to God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that hath given us the victory</hi> over ſinne and death: ſo that we may boldly ſay, <hi>Oh death! where is thy ſting? Oh grave! where is thy victory?</hi> If you be the Lords, and the Lord be yours, if you be Believers, you may triumph as the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Oh death! where is thy ſting?</hi> It is gone; nay, <hi>Oh death!</hi> (ſaith the Lord in the Propheſie of <hi>Hoſea</hi>) <hi>I will be thy deſtruction.</hi> I beſeech you, give not care, either to Satan, or to whatſoever inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath, that would poſſeſſe you, that though Chriſt dyed for you, and hath borne
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:175622:45"/>your ſins himſelfe upon the Croſſe, or upon the tree, (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth) yet thoſe ſame ſins will doe you hurt, and prove a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and bane to you. I ſay, there cannot bee greater deſpite done, nor affront offered unto Chriſt, then to make the Believer conceive that he was not able to beare their ſinnes, nor the wrath of God ſufficiently for them, but that they muſt be wounded, notwithſtanding all that Chriſt hath done. If Chriſt be hurt, as much as ſin can hurt him, how can any man be hurt by it, for whom Chriſt ſuffered? If Chriſt upon the Croſſe took the ſting out of it and carried it to his own grave, how commeth it to have a new ſting? or did Chriſt dye in vain? If he took away the ſting of one ſin, and not the ſting of another, there were need of another Chriſt, it ſeems, to take away that ſting that is behind, and ſo Chriſt hath not perfected for ever them that are ſanctified. I deſire you to heare with patience; this is the firſt ground of all your comfort in affliction, that ſin is gone, for then all afflictions in the world cannot diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſeeing all diſcomfort ariſeth from ſin, which is the ſting of affliction. Hereupon the Apoſtle triumpheth, <hi>Who can lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that juſtifieth, who can condemne?</hi> Contrariwiſe, the ſoul is in the greateſt bitterneſſe, when ſin remains, and the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:175622:46"/>ſting of it is not taken away, but when God is reconciled, as he is to the faithfull; for, <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelfe, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them;</hi> how then can finne do hurt? when it is not to be imputed? God doth uſe to reckon when he doth take payment. If God doth not reckon with men, he will never ſmite them with wrath; as is the wrath, ſo muſt be the ſmart, and harm, and hurt, that perſon is to ſuſtain, in reſpect of the ſins committed. Chaſtiſe he doth indeed, for ſpeciall ends, but the ſin doth not at all hurt: And though the Lord doth afflict, that will do you no hurt neither; afflictions are the phyſicke of God, to purge and ſanctifie the converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Will a man thinke, that is ready to dye of the ſtone, or wind-cholick, or ſtoppage in the fromach, if a Phyſitian comes, and gives him a bitter potion, that he doth do him any hurt, when he knoweth it is to recover his life, and ſave it? he knowes he dyes if he heals not the infirmity; God uſeth no phyſick, no chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and affliction, but it ſhall worke for good: ſo the Apoſtie expreſſeth it, in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. <hi>No af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction for the preſent is joyous, but grievous; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it bringeth forth the peaceable fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, to them that are exerciſed therewith.</hi> It brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th forth the peaceable fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, what hurt is there in all this?</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:175622:46"/>
               <p>But I muſt go on, and come to that which I have more particularly to deliver to you, and that is upon the conſideration of Gods mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, by which he doth attempt to prevail over the ſpirits of his people, not to be afraid, or diſmayed, come what can, or may come: you know God is beſt able to perſwade; God beſt knows what Rhetorick will take with his own people: A man that hath had the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a childe, and ſo comes to obſerve the temper of it, can better tell then any other, which way to win him: God hath the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own children; nay, God goeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he hath the ſpirits of his children at his own beck, and therefore can beſt tell which way to work upon their ſpirits, and to beget that in them which he calls for of them. The Lord would have them not to be afraid, nor diſmayed: Let the Lord propoſe his way to bring them to this compoſedneſſe, and fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, it is but preſumption in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to conceive, there may be better wayes to work upon the ſpirits of men, then that which God preſcribes. And it is worth your obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to conſider, that when the Lord puts his people upon a compoſedneſſe, and fixedneſſe of ſpirit, he doth not ſay, Fear not, for you have faſted, for you have prayed, for you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken your ſins, and denied your ſelves, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:175622:47"/>walked holily with me, and therefore, becauſe you have done this and that, Feare you not. The Lord doth not ſay ſo here, he hath higher Propoſitions that he propoſeth, that have more excellent vertue to move his people: He ſaith, <hi>Feare not, I am toy God; I will helpe thee, and uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſſe.</hi> The prop for the upholding of ſpirits againſt feare, when evill cometh, it is without a mans ſelfe, in him that is a rock, and unchangeable: The Lord doth not ſay, You change not, therefore you are not conſumed, you continually proceeded in holines, you waver not, therefore you are not conſumed: but, <hi>I am God, and change not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ſons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not conſumed.</hi> I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore again, If you would have ſetledneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, you muſt go out of your ſelves, and fetch peace of ſpirit out of God himſelfe; and I dare be bold to ſay, take all the ſweetneſſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of all the world, of all the creatures mixed together, extract the quinteſſence of their own excellencies, all theſe together ſhall never ſettle a heart, nor make it ſecure and free from fear, but only this propoſition, that God is their God. And by the fruit of this principle, a poor tottering ſpirit is under-propped, and under-ſet here with four pillars, at every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner one, as I may ſo ſay, <hi>I am thy God, I am with thee; I will helpe thee, I will uphold the with the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:175622:47"/>right hand of my righteouſneſſe:</hi> or rather, there is one main principle, and three ſubordinate ſupporters affixed unto the main principle, for ſometimes you ſhall ſee great weights laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome great pillar, and for the better ſecuring of that which is laid upon it; you ſhall have ſome ſhort pillars branching out from the main, ſpread out wide, and ſo upholding. This preſent diſcourſe ſeems to be ſuch a main prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that is, Gods being a God to ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>I am thy God,</hi> this is the foundation, this is the great pillar: <hi>I am with thee, I will helpe thee, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> they are the three ſupporters that do iſſue out of this main principle; for they are all but branches flowing from this priviledge of Gods being your God. Theſe I ſay are ſufficient to keep the moſt tottering ſpirit in the world immovable, like <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> never to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. I ſhall take the Principle, the main ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, into task, at this preſent, and therein conſider what excellency of ſupport there is in it: <hi>Fear not, I am with thee; be not diſmayed, I am thy God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the handling of this, that you may the better ſee what ſtability there is for a tottering ſpirit in this ſupport, let us conſider:</p>
               <p>Firſt, what it is for God to be thy God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what a perſon hath in this, who hath God for his God.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:175622:48"/>
               <p>Thirdly, by way of anſwering objections, ſhew how it is ſo well with thoſe that are the Lords, if this be true, that God himſelf is their God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, how God doth become their God, and upon what terms.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, how God will be found of them to be ſo as he is become.</p>
               <p>There are excellent uſefulneſſes if the truth be well fifted, and dived into.</p>
               <p>I will begin with the firſt, what it is for God to be thy God.</p>
               <p>There is much in it; nay, I will ſay more, there is more in it then is in any one thing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in Scripture. I will go yet further, there is all in it that doth concerne the preſent and future wel-being and happineſſe of a Believer, I ſay, all is in this one thing, <hi>I am thy God.</hi> While you have all things elſe but this, you have but the rayes of the Sun; while you have this, you have the Sun it ſelf in his brightneſſe, and glory, and luſtre. But to cleer this thing a little, what it is for God to be thy God, or my God, you muſt not underſtand, that the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks here in the full collection of all, nor that he is to be underſtood as ſpeaking in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number, becauſe he takes in the whole world, but he is to be underſtood, of all the members of Chriſt as one body, and alſo the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:175622:48"/>paſſage is to be underſtood diſtributively, of every ſuch particular perſon, and ſo he is thy God, and my God, and their God, <hi>I am their God,</hi> is all one with, <hi>I am thy God.</hi> In the Scriptures you ſhall finde a moſt vaſt difference betweene God ſimply and abſtractively conſidered, and God relatively conſidered; and that we muſt note beforehand, that you may know wherein the ſtrength and comfort of this paſſage lyeth. For God to ſay, <hi>Fear not, I am thy God,</hi> is ten thouſand times more comfortable, and hath more in it, then ſimply for God to have ſaid, <hi>Feare not, I am God.</hi> I ſay, there is farre more ſtability and ſupport in this expreſſion of God, conſidered as our God, then as he is conſidered ſimply and abſtractively without relation to us, for ſo it imports only to us the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, perfect and compleat being of God, as he is in himſelf. But God conſidered in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation here, as he is thy God, imports to us, not only what God is in reſpect of his abſolute perfection and compleatneſſe, but what he is to thoſe perſons whoſe he is, ſo that the phraſe doth import, not only what God ſimply is, but alſo, that whatever he is, in and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the ſame he is to thoſe perſons whoſe hee is. It is worth the obſervation, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures plainly hold out, that when ever the Lord is ſpoken of in reference to wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:175622:49"/>God is never mentioned in way of relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of propriety unto them, but only as he is ſpoken of in reference to his owne people. You ſhall not finde in all the Scripture, God ſaid to be the God of any perſon that is a wicked man. But, leſt there be a miſtake, you muſt know that this relation of God to people, may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, either as common, or as ſpeciall and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar. It is true, take a Church, as it is mixed, ſo ſometimes the Lord is ſpoken of in relation to them: as for example, in the 20. Chapter of <hi>Exodus, I am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, and out of the houſe of bondage.</hi> Here is God ſpoken of in relation, <hi>I am the Lord thy God;</hi> and this ſeems to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken collectively to the whole body of the Church, one with another; but alwayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this rule, Where the Lord is mentioned in relation to a mixed people, that is, a Church conſiſting of mixed perſons, all the priviledges from ſuch a relation of God, in reference to ſuch perſons, are but common priviledges: So in that very Text, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt;</hi> Obſerve, he calls himſelf indeed, their God, take them conjunctively, one with another. But wherein their greateſt priviledge was, which they had, in having him their God, he expreſſeth thus: <hi>I am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:175622:49"/>the Land of Egypt,</hi> which was but a common priviledge, and therefore, though God be ſaid to be the God of people, being mixed, yet he is not ſo their God, as he is the God of his own people, the living members of Chriſt: thoſe that are mixed, they receive ſome common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, or common things in that propriety; but they partake not of the whole propriety. Uſually in Scripture, the phraſe, <hi>I am thy God,</hi> is ſpoken only to the Lords ſervants, his choſen, that he will not caſt off, and ſo it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:175622:50"/>treaſure is mine, and this great revenew is mine and this land is mine, I ſay, what difference you obſerve between theſe two particulars, things ſimply conſidered, and things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as yours; the ſame difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God ſimply conſidered, and God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as thine. You know what difference there is in the ſpirits of men, looking upon things in theſe two conſiderations. There is this difference in outward things, a poor man looks upon the riches and honours of great men with a wan heart, and un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>omfortable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Now the ground of it is this, he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as none of his own. Two male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors are condemned to die, one hath a pardon ſent him, the other hath none now look how theſe two perſons do differ, looking upon this one pardon, ſo are you to conceive of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between God ſimply being God, and God being their God. Hee whoſe the pardon is, can ſay, It is my pardon, Oh, his heart leaps within him, conceiting he hath found a ranſome, he hath received his life again, his heart is taken up infinitly in the conſideration of his pardon; But look upon the other man, he ſeeth the ſame pardon, and looks upon it with a trembling heart, and ſad ſpirit. Now all the difference of the caſe of theſe two perſons, depends upon the propriety in the one, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:175622:51"/>want of propriety in the other: A wicked man may think of God ſimply as God, but he can never ſay, (til God reveal unto him that he is an elect perſon) that God is his God, and think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as his own God, ſee then how much thy caſe is better for thee to conſider God as thire then to conſider him in himſelf, and how great thy priviledge in of having God to be thy God.</p>
               <p>But what kinde of propriety is it? I anſwer, thus much it imports, as much as when thou ſayeſt, that ſuch money is thy money, or ſuch land is thy land. If you will have the nature of propriety, in the 5, of the <hi>Acts</hi> and 4. verſe, the Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le will tell you in generall, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety is: <hi>The land</hi> (ſpeaking of that which was ſold by <hi>Ananias</hi>) <hi>was it not thine own? When it was ſold, was not the money in thine owne fower?</hi> So then, for a man to have a thing as his owne, is to have it in his own power, to do with it as it is b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt, and moſt proſitable for his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to the utmoſt extent of the worth of the thing: As for example, ſuppoſe a man hath money in his purſe, he wants bread, he hath this mony in his owne power to diſpoſe of it for the ſupply of this want, and ſo in generall he may make uſe of all his money for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of all his wants: So Gods being a mans own God, imports, that ſo far as God will go, as I may ſo ſay, for a mans uſe, and for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:175622:51"/>of all his neceſſities; ſo far he hath power with him, God himſelf is ingaged to give forth himſelf to the utmoſt for ſuch a mans good. Now, Gods All-ſufficiency reaches beyond all wants; ſo that he that hath God for his God, he hath him for all the uſes, that can be for his good. If a man be many hundred pounds in debt, and hath land that is his owne, he may make uſe of it for the beſt to make him a free man again, ingaged to none: He may ſell it, and diſpoſe of it as far as it will reach, to pay his debts, and to procure his diſcharge. But if it be another mans land, and not his own, then he cannot make uſe of it to pay his own debts, but muſt remain as he was before: So the Lord is able to make up every thing that is defective or wanting, to all that have propriety in him; I do not ſay that a man can ſell the Lord, but I ſay, ſo far as God can reach, with his All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, ſo far may I draw up from him, as from a well of ſalvation, whatſoever I ſtand in need of; The believer hath as free and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable right in God, being his owne, as hee hath in the money in his purſe, and the land that is his owne. The one is not more in his power then the other. It is true indeed, a man may abuſe his land or moneys, and ſo he may abuſe God too, but uſing things as men uſe things that are their own, that is, for their
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:175622:52"/>beſt advantage, they have as much uſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God for the uſes they have occaſion to uſe him in, they have as much power with him as any thing in the world they conceive to be in their own power. When God gives gold and ſilver to men, he gives but ſome thick clay from himſelf, but when God communicates himſelfe, he gives all that he is; and he that hath God for his God, hath every thing that God is, or can doe. God can doe nothing in the world by his Omnipotent power, hee can deviſe nothing in the world by his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but all this is as much in propriety his, who hath God for his God, as it is Gods own. Gods propriety in himſelf, is but that he is his own; Gods peoples propriety in him is, that he is theirs. All the difference will be this: God in reſpect of himſelfe, hath the diſpoſing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by himſelf, and no other diſpoſeth of him, but himſelf: As for the people of God, becauſe they know not how to diſpoſe of him, as I may ſay, to their beſt advantage; therefore hee is pleaſed to give out himſelf according to their ſeverall occaſions, as he in his wiſdome ſeeth moſt conducing to their good, and ſo doth it for them: As for example, a father hath an Inheritance of his own, the childe of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath land by inheritance too; now du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring minority, the childe is not capable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:175622:52"/>it, now the one hath as much propriety in his land as the other, all the difference is this; the father diſpoſeth of his land for his own uſe himſelfe, the childe hath his land diſpoſed for his uſe by the father; but I ſay, the propriety is the ſame. So far as God may be uſefull for a creature, ſo far God is the creatures to doe good to the creature; I doe not ſpeak here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fooliſh fantaſie of ſome, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as if there were a tranſmutation of the creature into God, but I ſpeake of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his uſefulneſſe for accommodation, ſo far as it is poſſible for a creature to have him. He hath made over himſelfe in particular: man may have a propriety in God p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

Be it far from thee therefore, to think that God is able to do thus and thus, and to do good in ſuch and ſuch a caſe, and yet I cannot, I ſhall not have God for ſuch a good to may ſelfe; this man that ſo thinketh muſt needs conclude, God is not his God. Was it ever
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:175622:53"/>heard, that a man had money in his purſe, and yet wanted bread, and did periſh for want of bread, except there were no bread to be had, to be bought for money? So this is to deny the All-ſufficiency of God to think that he cannot, that he will not ſupply us with all needful bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; Aſſure your ſelves as God is your owne, ſo as far as may be for your good, you have him as much as any thing that is yours; only you have not the diſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng of him to your ſelves and for your ſelves, but that he hath in truſt for you. And this will ſerve to give a hint by way of anſwer to ſome queſtions by and by. Thus conſidering what men have, in having God let us now take it into our conſideration, what the ſtock and treaſure is, in having him to be our God. It is true, there are ſome things, in which creatures have propriety, and yet are little the better for them, in that the things they have propriety in, are not of ſufficiency: A woman may have propriety in a Husband, and yet ſhe may be a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gger, if he be a begger; ſhe can have no more then he hath; therefore propriety ſimply is no comſort, but the nature of the thing wherein there is propriety: If God bee an empty and ſcant propriety, then there were but little comfort in having God himſelfe but mark, God that doth make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf over in covenant, the God of ſuch a people,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:175622:53"/>is the greateſt, richeſt, moſt incomprehenſible treaſure that can be. You have heard of ſome, that have been raiſed from beggers, to huge and mighty eſtates, they have been had in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, that they ſhould be made ſo rich. What ſhould the ſons of men do, if they were able to apprehend what infinite ſuperlative treaſure they have all at once caſt upon them, when God caſts himſelf upon them. Beloved, I do conceive it a matchleſſe mercy of God, that he doth reveal but glimmeringly for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſome ſmatch of the trcaſure that we have in him for cortainly the over-brightnes, &amp; the over-excellency of that fulnes, he gives unto us in himſelfe, would ſwallow us up, we ſhould not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> able to endure the glory of it, if the Lord ſhould reveal all unto us; and that is the reaſon wherefore we know but in part now, becauſe we ſhould be confounded in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all that is to be known, and all what God is to his own people. There are three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars whereby ſpecially you may obſerve what great treaſure people have in having God to be their God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of the quality of the treaſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of the vertue of this treaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard of the ſoveraignty and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality and variety of helpfulneſſe in this treaſure.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:175622:54"/>
               <p>Firſt, in regard of the quality of the treaſure: men may have many things, which may be of little worth, for want of excellency of quality: There is a great deal of difference between a heap of Duſt in propriety, and a heap of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; he that hath one, may be a begger, and the others having the ſame quantire, is the richeſt man in the world: So we having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in God, are the richeſt perſons in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or earth, by reaſon of the excellencies that are in him. Some men have not many acres of land, but thoſe few acres they have, in regard of the riches of them, are more worth then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions of other acres: One acre, as I may ſay, of propriety in the Lord, is worth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the richeſt proprieties in the world. I ſay, ſo rich is God, and every thing that is in him. All things that are given to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oy, they are but beams of this Sun of righteouſneſſe, and if there be ſo much glory in the beams, what is there in the body of the Sun it ſelf? <hi>David,</hi> when he conſidered the countenance of the Lord, and the ſuperlative excellencies that are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he breaks out into admiration of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it: <hi>There be many</hi> (ſaith he in the 4 <hi>Pſal.</hi>) <hi>which ſay, Who will ſhew us any good? but Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us; and thou ſhalt put more gladneſſe into my heart, then when their corne, and wine, and oyle increaſe.</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:175622:54"/>Marke, while others look for good, he looks for the light of Gods countenance; when others looke for wine, and oyle, he looks for Gods gracious countenance, and having that, he lyes downe and ſleeps, as one filled and ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. There is abundance of treaſure and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative excellency in God; ſilver and gold are not to be compared untohim; Nay, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> comparing of <hi>ſilver</hi> and <hi>gold</hi> unto Chriſt, ſaith, they are but <hi>corruptible things</hi> in reſpect of Chriſts blood: how much more is God himſelfe, whereunto Chriſts blood is but the means? now the means is ſubordinate unto the end for which it is a means. If then the blood of Chriſt be ſo precious, that ſilver and gold are but corruptible things in compariſon of it, what is God, that the blood of Chriſt brings us unto?</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider the <hi>vertue</hi> of it: for God to be the God of people.

I mean this, that which you ſeek and inquire after from God as your God; is it ſomething you have nothing of? or, is it for more of ſomething you have already? If you ſay, it is ſomething I have nothing at all of: I have a ſtony heart, and I have no ſoftneſſe at all in it. That is falſe, there can be no ſeeking of God, where there is no ſoftneſſe, and all hardneſſe; for the Lord muſt firſt ſoften the heart to ſeek him. But you conceive there is no ſoftneſſe at all, becauſe the apprehenſion of that which is wanting, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows up that which is injoyed, and the want of that which you have not, ſwallows up that you have. Is it more that you would have in reſpect of meaſure? But you will ſay, Is it not good for me, though I have a little ſoftneſſe, to have more; and when I have a little ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to have more enlargedneſſe of ſpirit then I have?

Marke the Covenant well, where ever

The corruption in the heart of man gathers ſuch corrupt in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from hence, that pride riſeth in the heart from ſuch parts, that another Saint, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath a ſtammering tongue, though equally ſound hearted with himſelf, yet is not fit for ſuch a ones company. God is a wiſe God, he knowes the meaſure and proportion that is fit for every member of Jeſus Chriſt, and that proportion hee doth not with-hold. I ſpeake not this with any intent, but that people ſhould ſtill riſe to as much as can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but that people ſtill preſſe hard to the marke of the price of the high calling of God in Jeſus Chriſt. Beloved, when we ſeeke God in his owne way for increaſe of any good, for ſoul or body, let us ſtand to Gods good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and, beloved, for incouragement, let mee tell you, if ever the Lord would have with-held any thing for the ſinfulneſſe of his creatures, he would have with-held the gift of his owne Son, but while we were enemies, Chriſt dyed for us, would not God ſpare his owne Son, but deliver him up for us all, while wee were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: ſeeing the delivering up of his Chriſt, was for the good of his people, will he now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſmall things, in compariſon of him, in conſideration of weakneſſes in us? Marke the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:175622:60"/>Apoſtles words, he that ſpared not his owne Son, but delivered him up to death for us, how will he not with him give us all things that are good for us? as if he had ſaid, Thou poore wretch, wanteſt ſuch and ſuch ſpirituality, thou ſeekeſt them, and thou canſt not find them, and by and by thou cryeſt out, that ſuch and ſuch ſins hinder God, that he will not give thee ſuch grace as thou needeſt, and at laſt, thou queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, whether God did give thee Chriſt, or no; Nay, when thou wert viler then now thou art, thy vileneſſe then did not hinder, but that hee freely gave his Son for thee, thy vileneſſe much leſſe ſhall hinder thee now, to bar from thee thoſe ſpirituall gifts that God intends to give to thee. Here objections ſtart up, this is the way to make perſons ſlack duties, and to bee careleſſe: but if we would preach that God will not give till we mend our ſelves, and leave our ſins, were not this a far better way to put men upon it then thus to preach? let me tel you, we muſt not be more wiſe then God, that all that the creature hath, might appear to be from the grace of God, and ſo he have the praiſe of the glory of his owne grace; I ſay again, it is no ſinfulneſſe in the creature ſhall hinder Gods communicating ſo much of his Spirit as hee ſeeth uſefull to creatures, and he will take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they ſhall not take a licentious liberty
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:175622:60"/>to go on in ſin, or neglect ſeeking God, becauſe they know it is not their ſeeking makes God anſwer for what they want; for it is not your amending nor reforming, that gets God to communicate more to you, but that he doth it, is meerly for his own ſake, from his meer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, out of his meer compaſſion, the riches of which was purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, this is the only ſpring and fountain that brings forth to you the fulneſſe of God in ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as you have; as he is yours, ſo whatſoever in him is fit for you in ſeaſon, he ſhall ceaſe to be his owne, when he ceaſes to be yours, and therefore, beloved, I ſhall beſeech you, that you will not ſtumble at God himſelfe, as if he were ſo humourous and peeviſh, that every little thing, not that any ſin is in its owne nature little, but comparatively, every infirmity and failing, ſhould make him pull his hands into his boſome, and refuſe to give his grace; the Lord from all eternity, determined what to give to every Saint, and had every act of every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever before his eyes; ſo that if they would have been provocations to him to keep his gifts he ſhould never have beſtowed any upon him. But I muſt tell you, it is the foundation of all our comfort in all our failings in this life, that there is nothing that we enjoy from God, but what was appointed us before, and no ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:175622:61"/>committed, but what was from eternity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and if any ſin ſhould have hindered God, he would never have ſet down ſo fully and graciouſly what he would do; ſo that if the Lord hath already manifeſted the greatneſſe of his purpoſe and love, by communicating himſelfe to you, aſſure your ſelfe, this being eſtabliſhed, nothing in the world ſhall hinder the communication of any thing whatſoever, that may make for your good. Well, let us go a little further, and counder how God doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the God of people. I muſt tell you, that for lack of cleer diſtinguiſhing between theſe two things, how he doth become theirs, and how he is to be theirs, the confounding of theſe that are ſo diſtinct, occaſions a great deal of confuſion in the minds of men, for theſe two go al for one but you ſhall ſee the difference of them, and the different principle from whence they flow.</p>
               <p>Firſt, how doth God come to bee the God of people? You will ſay this is of great uſe, it is worth the hearing, let it coſt what it will, to have God for my owne: but I ſay, there is no more treaſure in God to be for our uſe, then it is free to; I ſay, the gift of God for our own God, is as cheap as it is rich. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looks the creature ſhould bring any thing that he might procure of God to be his God, but we do partake of this mearly and properly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:175622:61"/>from the pleaſure of his own will. I ſay, there is originally and efficiently, no other motive, nor nothing concurring to make him our God, but only the good pleaſure of his owne will, he would do, and he would do it ſimply for his own ſake; and therefore it is ſo. Beloved, look but upon the creatures, God communicates and gives his Image only to the ſons of men, <hi>Let us make man after our own Image:</hi> How doth man thus become partaker of the Image of God, more then the reſt of the creatures? You may plainly ſee, there is nothing in man himſelf, nor in any other creature, that procures this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to him. Man was made but of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lump with other creatures, he was made of the ſame materials, even that Toads and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were. Now, that which was the cauſe, why man had the Image of God, and no other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ſame is the cauſe why Believers have God given up, and God given up to bee their God, and the reaſon of both is from the good pleaſure of God. It is true, there is a propriety of land many times made over unto perſons, in reſpect of amiablenes or deſert conceived to be in theſe perſons, &amp; ſo it is conferred unto them; but in Gods conferring himſelfe to the ſons of men, there could not be ſuch motives in theſe creatures. The ground is this: if any thing could be a motive to the Lord, it muſt be the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:175622:62"/>moſt excellent thing the creature hath ſince the fall, their faſting, and prayer, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and weeping, and ſelf-deniall, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and cleanſing of themſelves, and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the like; but it was impoſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, there ſhould be any motive, out of any of all theſe things, for God to communicate himſelf, and to give himſelfe over to people; for all theſe performances, and what ever elſe are in man, they are but branches that iſſue from this main root, Gods being their God. If they be ſpirituall gifts, they iſſue out of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <hi>[God is our God];</hi> there is no man that believeth, that faſteth, that prayeth, that mourneth in a truly gracious manner, but God is firſt his God, and being his God, doth communicate theſe things to him. How can that then be a motive to God, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate himſelf to men, that is not in man till he hath communicated himſelfe? And indeed, is but the iſſue of that communion that he hath afforded unto men? So then, I ſay, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that God ſhould fetch any argument, or any motive to make himſelfe our God, from what wee do. And if wee could do any ſuch thing, yet there cannot be any moving power in ſuch performances, to obtaine God for our God; for in the very beſt of our performances, there is unrighteouſneſſe, there is filthineſſe;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:175622:62"/>any, the Prophet ſaith, <hi>that all our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags,</hi> ſweet motives to prevail with God, for ſuch a gift as to communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. No, beloved, it is not what we do, but what he in his own thoughts hath freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to do for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, Chriſt makes God to be our God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, beloved, in ſome ſenſe, that is true, but as I ſaid before, originally, Chriſt doth not make God to be our God Give me leave to open this clearly unto you, for I muſt tell you, that Chriſt himſelf is marvellous chary, and wary, not to aſſume, or take to himſelf that which belongs unto his Father, nor ſhould wee give to Chriſt himſelf that which belongs unto God peculiarly, as giving Chriſt himſelf unto us. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Give to</hi> Ceſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Ceſars, <hi>and to God the things that are Gods;</hi> and this holds as true between God and Chriſt, as Mediator, Give unto God the things that are his, and to Chriſt the things that are his: For our Saviour, in <hi>John</hi> 17. at the beginning of the Chapter ſaith, ſpeaking to the Father in prayer, <hi>I have finiſhed the worke that thou hast given me to doe:</hi> What worke was that? towards the latter end of the Chapter you ſhall finde: <hi>As thou Father art one in mee, and I in thee: ſo alſo they may bee one in us;</hi> as much as to ſay, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:175622:63"/>thou mighteſt communicate thy ſelfe to them: obſerve it, Chriſt doth profeſſe, that it is the work that his Father hath given him to do, that he did not put himſelfe upon it originally, but the Father did put him upon it. The truth is, the meer good pleaſure of God, contriving, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining, and ordaining this communicating of himſelfe, was the firſt originall and ground that Chriſt was ſent into the world, that hee was conceived in the womb of a Virgin, &amp;c. And the Lord by the obedience and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, hath actually brought all the benefits of the Goſpel upon us, to which end Chriſt hath done this work: But the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it, and the foundation of it, was the thing by which he was Chriſt and Mediator; and therefore Chriſt could not be the originall of that eternall decree and purpoſe of God to communicate himſelf to us, for the execution whereof Chriſt was ſent into the world. The Schooles have a rule, that the end of a thing is firſt intended, though it be laſt in execution; ſo this, that God would communicate himſelf to the ſons of men, being the end for which Chriſt was ſent, though till Chriſt had by vertue of his death made way, there was no actuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, yet ſtill it was the end of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world, it was in the mind of God before the means was in being. Therefore if
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:175622:63"/>you will have God to be your God, you muſt not thinke that ſuch and ſuch things will make God to be yours. Nothing will get God to be yours, but his owne free motion from himſelfe by his Son.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a way by which God is found to be the God of ſuch people<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> now theſe things being confounded together, put people into a labyrinth, thinking the way to find God, and to get God, is all one; now, although it is the meer good pleaſure of God himſelf, that doth beſtow himſelfe upon us; yet he is pleaſed to chalk out a way, whereby he may be found to be our God, and that we may find him to be ſo, we muſt meet God in thoſe wayes he uſeth to be met in.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, How doth God uſually manifeſt himſelfe, and how is he found of his people to be theirs?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, there is an efficient of our finding out of God, or a paſſive inſtrument of finding him out; the way of finding out of God effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to be our God, is the Spirit of the Lord, acquainting the ſpirits of men with the minde of the Lord. I ſay, he is the efficient. All the world is not able to work any impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſpirit of a man, that the Lord is his God, but only the Spirit of the Lord, muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the ſpirit of man, that he may receive
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:175622:64"/>this principle. It is true indeed, the Spirit of the Lord doth it according to the word of Grace, and ſpeaks no more to the ſpirit of a man, but what is in the word of Grace; but the word of Grace it ſelfe doth not of it ſelfe work this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that God is my God, or thy God, but the impreſſion is wrought by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> What ſerve all the Ordinances for, will you ſay? is not here a crying down of Ordinances? There will bee ſtill this ſcandall caſt upon us: But let me tell you, there is a moſt comfortable uſe of Ordinances, though they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erve not to ſuch high purpoſes as theſe are: I ſay, though they are not efficient to beget, and finde out, and reveale to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men the things that concerne God: yet beſides the efficient revelation of God to be our God from the Spirit alone, there is a paſſive in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>nowne to be the God of his people, but that way is meerly paſſive, and not active.</p>
               <p>Firſt, paſſively God makes himſelf knowne to be the God of his people, by the word of his Grace, and Faith laying hold upon the word of Grace revealed, and more ſubordinately in Prayer, Faſting, receiving of the Lords Supper, and ſuch Ordinances, ſo far as they are mixed
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:175622:64"/>with faith. Now give me leave in a few words to communicate unto you the full uſe and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent of Gods thoughts, concerning the Ordinances that he hath propounded, how far forth he would have the creature look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ordinances, and as much as may be, put upon the uſe of them, ſo farre forth as they are uſefull. Know therefore, as I ſaid before, that all theſe Ordinances are but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive wayes of conveying this great Gift, the knowledge of God to bee our God. I mean more plainly thus: Theſe Ordinances, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of, and in themſelves, empty dry chanels, or pipes, through which the Spirit of the Lord brings from God himſelfe the Spring, theſe riches, and conveyes the ſame into the ſpirit of a man: Look as a chanell digged in a dry ground, is the way through which the Spring conveyes his water into a Ciſterne, the chanell it ſelfe communicates none of its own, only it is a paſſage, through which the Spring conveys his water: ſo are all the Ordinances, even Faith it ſelf, Prayer, and all other ſervices, they are but chanels, through which the Spirit of the Lord paſſeth, and bringeth from the Lord himſelfe (the Spring and Fountain) the revelation of God to be our God. In all the reſt of the gifts of God, which hee hath ſo freely beſtowed, never a gift of Gods Spirit
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:175622:65"/>procures any thing of its own, our faith hath nothing of its own, faſting, and prayer have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their owne, but as the Lord hath been pleaſed to make theſe Ordinances to be paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to convey himſelf to the ſons of men, and ſo they are to bee made uſe of by the ſonnes of men: Faith, as it apprehendeth the Lord Jeſus, and other Ordinances as therein true faith is exerciſed, and no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>therwiſe. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, beloved, this is the load-ſtone to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke perſons to the uſe of all Ordinances, God hath ranked them together, that the Lord hath ſo much, and ſo often promiſed through them, to convey himſelfe: <hi>You are kept by the power of God through faith</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>unto ſalvation.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, The Lord doth convey himſelf, and the manifeſtation of his owne ſalvation through our beleeving. The Spirit of the Lord paſſing through the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, as the breath of man paſſeth through a Trumpet; the Trumpet is the inſtrument, the breath is the Spirit of the Lord, the Trumpet addes nothing to the breath. Now know, beloved, ſo far as you will attend the Ordinances, becauſe God calls out to Ordinances, and becauſe you have heard the Lord promiſe to beſtow ſuch things upon you in the Ordinances, ſo far you ſhall attend the Ordinances according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:175622:65"/>but when you aſcend ſo high, that the Ordinance doth get things, then you rob the Lord, and give more to Ordinances than God hath given; now, though the Ordinances have no efficiency of their own, in that nature I have ſpoken, yet there is good cauſe for all Gods own people to eſteem very highly of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to be joyfull of Ordinances, and to long much after Ordinances, to make much of them: For why? the Lord hath made his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to be found of them, and to be with them in Ordinances. <hi>In the day of adverſity, call thou upon me; and I will deliver thee.</hi> And here by the way, know from hence what is the exſpectatio of Believers themſelves, which they ought to have of the Lord, for ſuch things, when they come to ſuch Ordinances: that ſo, when wee attend the Lord in his Ordinances, we may find him in them. In <hi>Ezekiel</hi> you ſhall find, there was a conſtant motion, but it was becauſe there was a ſpirit ſtirring in the wheels; theres no motion in the heart of man nor ordinances in the world, but as the Spirit of the Lord is in them. The Lord hath promiſed to meet with us in theſe Ordinances, or elſe they would be as dry as any thing in the world. Therefore as the poor man lay at the beautifull gate of the Temple, not becauſe the gate would relieve him, but becauſe it was a place of concourſe,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:175622:66"/>where honourable men reſorted, from whom he might have almes: So in the Miniſtery, in Faſting, and Prayer, and all other ſervices, there is the gate of the Temple of the Lord, there is the place G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, what derogation is there all this while to the Ordinances, while wee make them but thus paſſive? The richeſt treaſure in the world may come to a man, through the pooreſt veſſell; the treaſure is never the farther off, nor never the worſe, becauſe the veſſell is poor.

               <p>Now, whereas he ſpeaks of Gods forgiving freely, he would not have people miſtake, as if his revealing of pardon of ſin, did intimate, that people did not ſin any more.

But the Apoſtle prevents this great objection, and he doth not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, but he eſtabliſhes the direct contrary to the infrence men make from the free Grace of God. And this he doth in the words of my
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:175622:69"/>Text. And obſerve it well, were it not an Apoſtle of Chriſt that ſpake theſe words, there are many Zelots in the Church would condemnit, not only for Hereſie, but for the greateſt abſurdity in the world. This appears plain, for there are two things the Apoſtle drives at, in theſe two verſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, an inforcement of ſomething that he would work upon little children, as he calls them, that have fellowſhip with the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the great argument the Apoſtle uſeth to prevaile with them to entertain and imbrace that which hee would faſten upon them.</p>
               <p>The thing that the Apoſtle would faſten upon believers was, <hi>that they would not ſin.</hi> For which cauſe he writes theſe things to them. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which he would prevail with them to do this he calls upon them for, is a ſtrange one in the opinion of moſt men. Obſerve the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father,</hi> &amp;c. Put them together, and it amounts to this; I would have you not to ſin. Now, the only way, and the beſt way, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with you not to ſin, is this, I will acquaint you with this truth, that if you do commit ſin, there is an advocate with the Father, that ſhal take order that the ſin you commit ſhal do you
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:175622:69"/>no hurt at all. Though you do ſin, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the propitiation for your ſins; therefore feare not, though you doe ſin, of any hurt that can come to you by theſe ſins. So that this is the argument by which he would prevail with them, and us againſt the commiſſion of ſin. Now, what an abſurd argument ſeems this to be, not only to the world, but even to zealous profeſſors alſo, to prevail with men to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of ſin, to tell them before hand, that if they ſin, there is an advocate for them, and he is the propitiation for their ſins? That this is an argument for men to forbeare ſin, is ſuch a Paradox, not only to the world, but even to profeſſors themſelves, that for ought I ſee, in matters of Religion, at this day, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo vilely calumniated, as the publiſhing of this free grace of God to men, in this way, as being the high way to break out into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſinfulneſs whatſoever. This, ſay men, is that which lets go the reins into the neck of Libertiſme; this is that which makes men take liberty without controule, freely to commit any ſin in the world. Who ever is of this mind, I muſt tell him, before I go on, he doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly croſſe the wiſdome of God, and directly give the lie to the Apoſtle here, that expreſſeth with much infallibility to the world, how little hurt the knowledge of the pardon of ſin can do
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:175622:70"/>do to perſons in Jeſus Chriſt, in that he paſſeth it as an argument to prevail from ſin. I ſhall beſeech you, beloved, not to have any regard to any words I ſhall ſay of my ſelfe to you, but as I ſhal ſpeak the full mind of the Holy Ghoſt; And I ſhall give you one point firſt in generall, which is the main ſcope of the Apoſtle here, and afterwards handle the ſeverall branches of it particularly.</p>

Beloved, is not here compliance to this man provoked by the graciouſneſſe and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:175622:71"/>revealed from ſuch a man, that he will ſhew? Yea, this mercy and favour revealed, is the ſpur to cauſe him to comply. So the Apoſtle ſaith here: <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous. Theſe things I write unto you, that you ſin not.</hi> It is plain therefore, that the knowing what ſhall become of our ſins; namely, that they ſhall do us no hurt; the knowing of this before hand, is not the opening a ſluce or a floud-gate to provoke to ſinfulneſſe, but a bridle to reſtrain men from ſin: For you ſhall finde by conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Scripture, that the Holy Ghoſt is not rare, but very plentifull in opening of this very truth, that the free Grace of God, and the ſecurity of a believer from ſin, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made maifeſt, that believers might not ſin.</p>
               <p>Look in the third Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſee how fully the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts this very buſineſs we have now in hand.

But now, whats the fruit of all this? The Apoſtle in his time found, that the preaching of this free grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men as they are ſinners, raiſed this very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that is on foot to this day, &amp; I believe, will be to the end of the world; and therefore mark the laſt ver. of that Chapter, after he had ended this great diſcourſe, and laid down his foundation &amp; ground, that a man is <hi>juſtified by faith, without the works of the Law;</hi> The object. that comes in is this: <hi>Do we make void the Law through faith?

Who will not take liberty to ſin, when he knows, that though he doth ſin, though his ſins be never ſo great, all his ſins ſhall be done away, he ſhall not receive any hart at all by them, though he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them? is not this to make void the Law, you will ſay?

This ſaith the Apoſtle is a doctrine that doth eſtabliſh the Law, and not make it void, that is, it doth eſtabliſh men in obedience to the will of God, and bring them neerer in conformity to the Law, and doth not ſet men looſe to the breaking, and violating, &amp; fruſtrating of the Law, and to prophaneſs.</p>

                  </gap> God to us, being conſidered as loſt perſons in <hi>Adam,</hi> at the beginning of the 6. Chapter, at verſ. 1. the Apoſtle meets with the ſame objection in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and anſwers it more fully then he did before: The objection is this; <hi>Shall we continue in ſin that grace may abound? God forbid,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?</hi> The ſumme and ſubſtance of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:175622:73"/>is this: Is there ſo much Grace, that where ſin hath abounded, Grace aboundeth much more? then it ſeems, that the more ſin a man doth commit the more will the glory of the Grace of God appear in the pardoning of theſe ſins, and ſo I ſhall gloriſie God beſt, when I commit ſin moſt, will ſome ſay. So that the preaching of the abundance of grace where ſin hath abounded, ſeems to let men looſe to the commiſſion of ſin as much as poſſibly. The Apoſtle anſwers this with, <hi>God forbid:</hi> as if he had ſaid, God will never ſuffer any Believer, though never ſo weak, through any ſuch truth reveal'd, to break out into any ſin, becauſe wher ſin hath abounded grace hath abounded much more, God will never have them to make any ſuch abominable inference from ſuch truths: And he alſo gives the reaſon why they cannot make ſuch uſe of the grace of God. <hi>How ſhall we that are dead unto ſin, live any longer therein?</hi> to the Apoſtle, the inference of the objectors from this argument, ſeems ſo abſurd, that he doth appeal to the adverſaries themſelves, how ſuch an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as this can follow ſuch a Propoſition. He doth not ſay poſitively, that they cannot live in ſin that are dead to it, but he puts the queſtion to them how it can be? And whereas ſome may anſwer; yea, they may eaſily do it. No, ſaith the Apoſtle, they that are partakers of this
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:175622:73"/>Grace, are dead unto ſin, and how can they live in it, when they are dead to it? The glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power of this Grace revealed, ſtrikes ſinne dead in men, or rather ſtrikes men dead to ſin. <hi>Sinne ſhall not have dominion over you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>for you are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> And as you ſhall heare by and by, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle makes the very Grace of God to have that power in it, as to breake the neck of ſin in the Believer. This is the moſt certaine truth of the Text, and ſprings directly from it. There is a death unto ſin, where there is a revelation, effectually of the Grace of God to perſons to whom it doth belong. It brings a dart with it to ſlay ſin. <hi>The law of the Spirit of life that is in Chriſt, hath freed mee from the law of ſin, and death; and what the law could not doe, in that it was weake through the fleſh, God ſent forth his Son in the ſimili tude of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh;</hi> ſo that although to reaſon and ſenſe, the preaching of the free Grace of God to men, and to publiſh what the Lord, hath done for them for his own ſake, and that before-hand, may ſeem to be a doctrine that gives liberty to ſin, and ſo to be a licentious doctrine; yet it ſeems to the Apoſtle, that there is nothing that doth more eſtabliſh a reſtraint from ſin, then the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation hereof.</p>
               <p>In the 11. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> towards the latter
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:175622:74"/>end of the Chapter, the Apoſtle tells us, that God hath concluded <hi>all men under ſinne that hee might ſhew mercy upon all:</hi> and therefore he falls out into admiration, <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the Wiſdome and Knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judgements, and his wayes aſt finding out!</hi> Now, what follows? Having prevealed this unſearchable Grace, ſee how hee begins in the 12. Chapter and 1. verſe: <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, which is your reaſonable ſervice. And be not conformed to this world; but bee transformed by the renewing of your mindes,</hi> that is, I beſeech you by the mercies of God, that you refraine from ſinne. What mercy doth he meane? Even the mercies of God concerning the freeneſſe of his Grace, manifeſted before in all the 11. Chapter. Now, if the Apoſtle had beene of ſome mens mindes, that the preaching of the free Grace of God were a dangerous doctrine to ſet men looſe to ſin, he would never have uſed the mercies of God as an argument to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with men to refrain from ſin. Hee would not have publiſhed that which ſhould have been of ſuch dangerous conſequence, but he would rather have been filent, ſo far would hee have been from revealing of it as an argument to the contrary, were the revelation of it the way to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:175622:74"/>bring men to looſeneſſe and licentiouſneſſe, it had been the wiſdome of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Apoſtles, to have concealed it, which certainly he would have done, had it been ſo. But the Apoſtle was not of that judgement; and therfore, in 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> chap. 6. and towards the latter end, he draws his argument after the ſame manner: <hi>You are not your owne, you are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God in your bodies, and ſpirits, for they are Gods.</hi> Obſerve here, that the injunction which the Apoſtle gives the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> is, that they ſhould glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in their bodies and ſpirits; and what is the argument by which he would perſwade them to it? <hi>You are bought with a price:</hi> But, will ſome ſay, it ſeems I am bought, and the price is laid downe for me now, I am ſure enough, I am ſafe, the gates of hell cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt me, I may live as I liſt, for no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will follow now, I may take liberty to ſin. Now, if the Apoſtle had known that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence would juſtly have followed upon the preaching of this Crace, he had dealt very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteouſly with the people of God, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly by inforcing a concluſion from a ground contrary to it, by revealing ſuch a doctrine as this is. Therefore ſurely the Apoſtle would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have uſed this expreſſion of being <hi>bought with a price,</hi> if he had knowne that this would
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:175622:75"/>follow: but contrariwiſe, he knew that there is no way in the world, will ſo much prevaile with Gods people to leave their ſins, as by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them before hand, that their ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them, and that they are bought with a price.</p>
               <p>In 2 <hi>Titus,</hi> from the beginning to the 12. <hi>v.</hi> you ſhall finde how the Apoſtle urgeth <hi>Titus,</hi> that hee preſſe a holy converſation anſwerable to old men and old women, as alſo to young women, and young men; and alſo a converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuitable to ſervants: and eſpecially he writes concerning them, that they ſhould not purloin from their maſters, but ſhew all faithfulneſſe. But what is the argument now, by which the Apoſtle urgeth all theſe things upon theſe men? See in the 12. and 13. verſes, and you ſhall finde, that the argument is the ſame we have now in hand: <hi>For the Grace of God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that brings ſalvation hath appeared, teaching us to deny all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe and worldly luſts, and that we ſhould live righteouſly, ſoberly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi> As much as to ſay, The Lord hath made known, and revealed his ſalvation to you, and you ſee it before you, Salvation is brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; and not your well-doing, but the Grace of God is that which brings this ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you. Then may I doe what I liſt, will ſome ſay: No, ſaith the Apoſtle, This Grace of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:175622:75"/>God that brings ſalvation, brings this too; It teacheth us to deny al ungodlineſſe and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts; and that we ſhould live godlily; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and righteouſly in this preſent world. I ſay, it is blaſphemy againſt the truth of the Holy Ghoſt in theſe ſeverall paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſay, or to maintaine, that this is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary inference from the revelation of the free Grace of God to men before-hand, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men will breake out into ſin and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and give up themſelves thereto, and that this is the way to give up the reines into the neck of vice and licentiouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>I will give you but one paſſage more, although I confeſſe, I have gone further in the cleering of this buſineſſe by Scripture, then I intended: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe. I know it ſticks ſo in the hearts of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers and quarrellers, and cavillers that are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſpit fire into the faces of thoſe perſons that are aſſertors and maintainers of the free grace of God, and the publiſhers thereof to the people of God. I will give, I ſay, but one place more in confirmation hereof; namely, that which the Apoſtle delivers in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. the words are theſe, <hi>He that is borne of God ſinneth not</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>becauſe the ſeede of God abides in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe hee is borne of God. Hee that is borne of God;</hi> What is that? It is no more but this, he that is received into Grace by
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:175622:76"/>Chriſt, becomes one with Chriſt in reſpect of the ſpirituall union between Chriſt and ſuch a perſon. To bee borne of God, and to be a new creature, is all one. To be new creatures, is to be ſuch as wee were not before. More fully, a new creature is a perſon that is tranſlated from himſelfe into Chriſt, and he ſtands before God as Chriſt himſelf, and not as he is in, or of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Now, ſuch a perſon, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſinnes not; becauſe the ſeede of God abides in him; nay, he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> There may bee ſome difficulty in the expreſſion, but you muſt know, the intention of the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> here, is to take off the objection againſt the Doctrine of the free Grace of God, that it is a licencious Doctrine, to take off, I ſay, the reproach that is unjuſtly caſt upon it. And ſo the meaning of the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> is this, <hi>Hee that is borne of God ſinnes not,</hi> that is, hee cannot take ſuch liberty to ſinne, he cannot make ſuch licentious uſes of the Grace of God, as to walk in ſinfull courſes, though his ſins ſhall not hurt him. I ſay, this Licentious living in ſin, is the thing the Apoſtle ſpeakes of here: <hi>Hee that is borne of God ſins not.</hi> And the reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the ſeed of God abide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:175622:76"/>liberty and power that naturally it would have, by vertue of ſuch a Principle implanted; Not that the Apoſtle ſpeakes abſolutely of ſin, that a childe of God ſhall ſinne no more; for that were to make the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> himſelfe the lier, and that by his owne words; and to ſpeak againſt himſelfe: For he ſaith in another place; <hi>Hee that ſaith hee hath no ſin, deceives himſelfe, and is a lier:</hi> And King <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo, who ſaith, that <hi>there is not a juſt man upon earth that doeth good, and ſinneth not,</hi> Eceleſ. 7.20. Therefore by ſinne in this place, he muſt needs mean a licentious liberty taken unto ſin.</p>
               <p>Beloved, I know there are many objections raiſed againſt this truth; I ſhall briefly run through ſome of them to you, and if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, clear this truth unto you at this time, and vindicate the Goſpell from thoſe abominable untruths caſt upon it; and that I will do the rather, becauſe thouſands in the world turne away from the Grace of God, and dare not venture themſelves upon it: Becauſe they fear, if they ſhould adventure themſelves upon theſe principles of free Grace, they ſhould preſently take liberty to ſin, and ſo fall away and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatize: Oh! how many have miſcarried and refuſed their owne mercies, and have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Goſpell to this day upon ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, that the receiving of it ſhould make them
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:175622:77"/>break out into ungodlineſſe. I know here are many here preſent, cannot but witneſſe, they are affraid to cloſe with free Grace, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo fully proved and manifeſted in Scripture upon this conſideration, that it will make them live looſely.</p>

The end of Chriſts coming, and preaching the free grace of God to men, is this very thing, that in it the Lord might proclaime liberty to the captives, which are Chriſts owne people. Chriſt came of purpoſe, as you ſhall finde in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. <hi>to deliver thoſe, who through feare of death, are ſubject to bondage all their lives long.</hi> And therefore, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free, you ſhall bee free in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2 But ſome will ſay, It is a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty that Chriſt allows, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a liberty that Chriſt gives men to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the captivity and bondage of ſin, which they were under before: But many that profeſſe this doctrine, are knowne to be more ſlack in the performance of duties, and to grow more and more cold in their zeale, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in the practice of Religion, and are more regardleſſe of ſin; and in a word, take more liberty to ſinne ſince ſuch Grace hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For anſwer to this, Beloved, firſt you are not to expect perfection of works from Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in this life, and that they ſhould be free from all manner of ſin. I know none of thoſe that have the moſt indignation againſt this doctrine of the free grace of God to men, but will yeeld, that they themſelves are not without failings, they ought not therefore to aggravate the weakneſſe of their brethren, much leſſe ought the truth of God to bee charged with the failings of men. But ſuppoſe ſome do make evill uſes of the free Grace of God ſometimes, &amp; are therby encouraged to be more bold with ſin; as they are not to be upheld in it, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, ſo ought not their fault to be laid upon the free Grace of God, which effectually tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us the contrary: For, though Beleevers
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:175622:78"/>in infirmity may happen, at ſome times or other, to be overcome with ſtrength of paſſion and corruption, to fall into ſin, upon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that the free Grace of God will ſave them; yet ſhall we therefore conceal this Grace of God, becauſe men take that liberty which it doth not give? I ſay, beloved, if this ſhould be a ſtanding rule, God ſhould never have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the Goſpell to the ſons of men. I know no Beleever ſo perfect in a courſe of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and obedience, and abſtinence from ſin, but his corruption may occaſion him to take advantage, even from the Goſpell it ſelfe, to ſin. But certainly, I dare be bold to affirm, there is not any Believer, that is a true Beleever indeed, that doth maintain this Principle, that he may ſin without controule, becauſe the free Grace of God hath abounded. I dare ſay further, that it is a bold ſlander, and that no man is able to make it good from true evidence, that there is any that doth take conſtant and frequent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to break out into ſinfullneſſe, becauſe he knows what ſhall become of him, and that his ſins are done away by the blood of Chriſt, ſo that they ſhall do him no hurt. For the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of this, doth certainly and effectually teach and produce an hatred of ſin, and a love of holineſſe; So that certainly, this is more then can bee proved againſt any true Beleever,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:175622:78"/>that he ſhould approve himſelf in any ſin upon this ground. If indeed Beleevers were in their owne keeping, then what ſinne might they not fall into? But they doe not ſtand upon their own legs, they do not go in their own ſtrength, they do not walk by their own principles; for, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>You are kept by the mighty power of God through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. And againe, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, The life that I now live, is by the faith of the Son of God that loved me, and gave himſelf for me, and I live, yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me.</hi> It is not a Believer now that lives, but it is Chriſt that lives in him, and he is the predominant principle whereby his actions are ſwayed: And as the Beleever is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along according to the principles of Chriſt he cannot fall into ſin. It is true indeed, Chriſt for reaſons beſt knowne to him, may let looſe the reins and the cords wherewith hee holds a Beleever for a while, and then he may fall into ſin; but this comes to paſſe, becauſe the Grace of God is hid, and not becauſe it is manifeſted unto him, and beleeved by him; and at length the power of Chriſt ſhall pul them in againe, and reſtrain them, even by thoſe cords of love, whereby they were firſt drawn unto him. And the Beleever hath the ingagement of Chriſt himſelf, that hee will never, faile him, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him; and hee hath promiſed, that his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:175622:79"/>ſtrength ſhall be made perfect in weakneſſe, and his grace ſhall be ſufficient for him. And that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But ſome will ſay, There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that doe admire and adore the Doctrine of the free Grace of God, that yet are notoriouſly known to live in all manner of lewdneſſe and licentiouſneſſe, and that upon this ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſins are laid upon Chriſt; and they ſay, we may live in ſin, and do what we liſt, and what is their argument? Oh, ſay they! our ſins are laid upon Chriſt, and Chriſt died for them.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For anſwer to this, I profeſſe, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard from any perſon of credit, that there are any ſuch monſters as theſe are, that dare preſume to make it their practice to be drunk, and to break the Sabbath, and to curſe, and to ſwear, and to live in uncleanneſſe, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of vileneſſe and abomination, becauſe all their ſins are laid upon Chriſt, that ſay, they are Beleevers, and they ſhall doe well enough.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:175622:79"/>There are many that are taxed for ſuch; but for mine owne part, I cannot ſay any thing to the truth of this charge, by mine owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of any man in the world: But it may bee there are ſuch monſters as theſe are, in the world: And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid there were ſuch in his time, that becauſe the Grace of God did abound, therefore would make ſinne to abound, and turne the Grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe; and therefore it is probable there are ſuch now. And if there be any ſuch, let me deal plainly with them, for my part, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them the greateſt monſters upon the face of the earth, the greateſt enemies to the Church that ever were; and I ſay of ſuch diſhonourers of the Church, and diſturbers of the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods people, that they are carnall, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall, and devilliſh. They are the greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the free Grace of God, and the greateſt ſubverters of the power and purity of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the greateſt hinderers of the courſe of it, that are under heaven: And I dare be bold to ſay, open Drunkards and Harlots, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, that profeſſe not the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, come infinitly ſhort of thoſe perſons in abomination. No perſons in the world, do ſo wound the ſides of Chriſt, as he that doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Goſpel, and yet live wickedly. And if there be any ſuch here, let me tell them, their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:175622:80"/>faith is no better then the faith of devils; for they believe and tremble, and that Chriſt will have a heavier reckoning and account for ſuch when they come to judgment, then for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under heaven beſides. How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands have forſaken their own mercy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the free Grace of God, accounting it a licentious doctrine, and a doctrine giving li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſin, and all becauſe of the occaſion that ſuch perſons as theſe do give by their vile converſation? Well, beloved, admit that the free Grace of God hath been thus abuſed by ſuch wretches, look over the whole Scripture, hath not the whole Scripture, both Law and Goſpel, been abuſed, as well as this particular Grace? Is not Chriſt ſet up and appointed for the riſing and falling of many in Iſrael? Is not he appointed as well to be a ſtumbling ſtone for the falling of many, as to be a corner ſtone for the riſing of many? Is not Chriſt ſet up as a Rocke for ſome to build upon, but to daſh others in pieces? Is not he ſet up for a ſtone of offence to grinde many to powder, as well as to be a foundation ſtone to others? Aſſure your ſelves, the Goſpel of Chriſt, as it ſhall make Believers far more holy then they can bee that receive not the Goſpel: So there are ſome that ſhall grow far more filthy, and take occaſion from the Goſpel and Grace of God to this fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:175622:80"/>But in the mean time, ſhall the children want their bread, becauſe Dogs catch at it? Will not you give your child a bit of food all the day, and all the week, becauſe when you give it them the Dogs ſnatch at it, and it may be pull ſome of it out of their hands? Shall the children ſtarve for want of bread, becauſe Dogs abuſe it? Nay, beloved, the children muſt not want their bread, becauſe Dogs abuſe it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we make that bitter and ſowre which God hath made ſweet: Becauſe wicked men abuſe the Goſpel and free Grace of God, ſhall the people of God be deprived of that which God hath appointed and provided for them? Let me aske this queſtion of you: Did not the Lord himſelf, from everlaſting, as cleerly ſee and know, even long before he did reveal it, how his free Grace ſhould be abuſed, when it ſhould bee preached, as wee our ſelves ſee it abuſed? If it be ſuch a dangerous and pernicious thing to preach the free Grace of God, why did hee give ſuch a large commiſſion, and ſuch a ſtrait charge to his Apoſtles and Miniſters to preach it to every creature? If the publication of it be ſo dangerous, who muſt be blamed for it? muſt not God himſelfe that hath commanded us to preach it? Beloved, if the Miniſters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if Miniſters out of a carnall and needleſſe fear of liberty, inſtead of preaching the mind of God, ſhall preach themſelves; (let it be never ſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and well liked of by men) they ſhall bee judged of God as coming in their own names, as being not ſent by him.</p>

This is the Grace of God revealed, and he hath revealed it, and exhibited it thus freely to men. Now, is this the Lord himſelfe that ſpeaks it? Hath the Lord given us commiſſion and charge to preach this Goſpel and Grace of his, and ſhall we be blamed and oppoſed, and ſcandalized for ſpeaking thoſe things that God hath commanded us to ſpeak, and hath put into our mouths, ſaying, we preach a doctrine of looſneſſe and licentiouſneſſe, and give men leave to do what they liſt?

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:175622:82"/>a covenant of Works? Look into the 54. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the 9. verſe, and you ſhall ſee how it is a belying of God, to ſay, that Believers may come under wrath and damnation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they doe thus and thus; the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks there of the time when the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall inherit the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that is, the time of the Goſpel. In the beginning, the Lord tells us of an everlaſting kindneſſe, that ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver depart, nor be made void, and he confirms it thus: <hi>This is as the water of</hi> Noah <hi>unto mee, ſaith the Lord, for as I have ſworne that the waters of</hi> Noah <hi>ſhall never goe over the earth againe, ſo have I ſworne, that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee: The mountaines ſhall depart, and the hills ſhall bee removed, but my loving kindneſſe ſhall not depart from thee; neither ſhall the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of my peace be removed, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it well; hath God made ſuch an oath concerning theſe very times ſo firme, and ſo ſtable, that the earth ſhall be drowned againe with water, before it ſhall be broken; <hi>That hee will not be wroth with his people, nor rebuke them any more;</hi> and ſhall wee ſay to the people of God, ſhall we tell Believers, if they ſinne, they ſhall come under Gods wrath, and except they do ſuch and ſuch good works, God will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them, and that after he hath ſo ſworn and ingaged himſelf, that he will not be wroth
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:175622:83"/>with his people any more? Is not this to make God a lier? Againe wee doe not only ſo much as lies in us, make God a lier, but we offer an inſufferable affront unto Jeſus Chriſt, and ſtrike at the very heart of the whole office of Chriſts Mediatorſhip. If wee ſay that God is wroth with Beleevers for whom Chriſt died; for what end did Chriſt ſuffer death? I ſay, if this principle bee a truth, that God will bee wroth with his people, and angry with them, then Chriſt died in vaine: For God could have been but wroth, hee could have been but angry with his people, if Chriſt had never died And to bring the people of God under wrath and vengeance againe for their ſins, is to take away all the vertue of the death of Chriſt, and to make it of none effect: And how will this principle ſtand with that in the 53. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where it is ſaid, that he beheld the travell of his ſoul, and was ſatisfied? Was God ſatisfied with ſufrerings of Chriſt, having the ſinnes of men laid upon him, and yet is God wroth and angry with Beleevers for thoſe very ſins again, which before hee acknowledged ſatisfaction for? If ſo be a man be indebted unto another, and the creditor be willing to take a ſurety for the debt, and this ſurety comes in and payes this debt for the man hee was bound for, and hee thereupon gives a generall diſcharge under
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:175622:83"/>hand and ſeal, ſhal he yet by &amp; by after take the debter by the throat, and clap him up in Gaol, when the ſurety hath anſwered for the debt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and after hee hath delivered under hand and ſeal that he was ſatisfied, and that his book was croſt? Who but muſt ſay it is injuſtice in the higheſt degree? What juſtice, what equity is in this? Beloved, Chriſt became our ſurety, God accepted of him for our debt, he clapt up Chriſt in Gaol, as I may ſo ſay, for the debt: God tooke every farthing of Chriſt that hee could demand of us; he is now reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, he will not now impute our ſins to us, he hath acknowledged ſatisfaction, it is upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; And now ſhall he come upon them again with freſh wrath, for whom Chriſt hath done all this? Shall hee charge the debt upon them againe? He hath forgotten the death of Chriſt, it ſeems, if this be true. Therefore know thus much, that it is againſt the death of Chriſt; it is a making of it of none effect; it makes the coming of Chriſt to be in vaine, to ſay that the wrath of God will breake out upon Beleevers, if they commit ſuch and ſuch ſinnes. And for this that I have ſaid, If any man can produce one Scripture againſt it; if any man can ſhew in all the Booke of God, that it is any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then I have delivered, for my part, I ſhall be of another minde, and willingly recant my
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:175622:84"/>opinion. But I ſee the Scripture runs wholly in this ſtrain, and is ſo full in nothing as in this, that God hath generally diſcharged the ſins of Beleevers. Oh then, take heed of falling into that error of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that ſay, that God hath taken away the ſinne, but not the wrath of God due to ſinne; that he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given our ſins, but not the puniſhment of ſin: But I beſeech you conſider, that as our ſinnes were then upon Chriſt, he was ſo bruiſed for our iniquity, that by his ſtripes we are healed, and the chaſtiſement of our peace was ſo upon him, that he being chaſtifed for our ſins, there is nothing elſe but peace belongs to us: And the chaſtiſement of our peace was ſo upon him, that he beheld the travell of his ſoule, and was ſatisfied. Chriſt was ſo chaſtiſed, as I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaid, with the rod of Gods wrath, that it was quite worne out, and wholly ſpent it ſelfe upon him. This is apparent in the very tenor of the new Covenant it ſelf: It runs altogether upon free Gift and Grace. God takes upon himſelf to do all that ſhall be in Believers, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and requiring nothing at all of us. It is true, he ſaith there ſhall be the new heart, and a new ſpirit, and that there ſhall bee a new Law written in the inward parts: But hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it not of the Believer, but hee himſelfe hath undertaken to doe all, and beſtow upon
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:175622:84"/>the Beleever. <hi>A new heart will I give thee, and a new ſpirit will I put into thee; and I will take away thy ſtony heart, and I will give thee a heart of fleſh.</hi> Hee doth not ſay, you muſt get you new hearts, and new ſpirits, and you muſt get your ſtony hearts taken away; and you muſt get you hearts of fleſh. But I will take the worke in hand, and I will ſee all done my ſelf. All runs freely upon Gods undertaking for his people. Seeing therefore God doth all things freely of his own accord in us, then, beloved, ſee how the Grace of God is abuſed by thoſe that would make men beleeve, that the Grace of God depends upon mens doings and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, upon actions in the creature, and tell men, if they doe it not, the wrath of God will follow thereupon. This likewiſe batters down to the ground that way of urging men to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which ſome men hold forth; that if men doe not theſe and theſe good workes, and leave theſe and theſe ſins, then they muſt come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wrath of God, and that the wrath of God is but hidden all this while they doe theſe and theſe good works, but if they faile in any of theſe, then the wrath of God will breake out upon them; whereas they ought rather after the example of the Apoſtle, to excite them to theſe good workes, becauſe they are already freed from wrath. Certainly, this that I have
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:175622:85"/>delivered proves this ſufficiently, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the Grace of God doth teach men to doe the will of God effectually, the love of God conſtrains the faithfull, and not the feare of wrath.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, do not miſtake me, in the mean while, I have no thoughts, as if wrath and vengeance were not to be preached, and made known even to Believers; yea, beloved, wrath and vengeance is to be made known to them, and that as the deſerts of ſin, and as the means to keep men from ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But now, ſome may ſay, this ſeems to be againſt all that you have ſaid before, this ſeems to overthrow all that you have delivered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Obſerve me well, do not miſtake me, You muſt know, that wrath and vengeance muſt be revealed to Believers, and it muſt bee known to the end to reſtraine them from ſin, but not in that way men doe ordinarily think; I mean thus: Wrath and vengeance is not to be revealed, as if Beleevers were to fear them, or as if Believers ſhould come under them; but wrath and vengeance is to be revealed, as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are ſecured and freed from them, that ſo they ſhould fear to commit and fall into ſin, not for feare of coming under wrath, but out of love, becauſe God hath beene ſo gracious to them, as to deliver them from the weight of ſo
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:175622:85"/>heavie wrath and diſpleaſure, that otherwiſe muſt of neceſſity have fallen upon them, and ſo their walking with God in a holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a fruit of the mercy already ſhewne, and doth not goe before, as a thing by which the mercy ſhould be obtained and procured. They ſerve God, becauſe they are delivered from wrath, and not becauſe they might receive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from under wrath. It proceeded from joy, in conſideration of wrath already paſt, and not from feare of wrath to come; ſo that the wrath of God is preached unto them, not that they are to come under it, or that they are in that way to fear it; but that they may ſee what they are delivered from, that they may ſee what they did, and ſhould, and others muſt lie under; that they may ſee Gods love unto them therein, that this may draw them to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and that this might reſtraine them from ſin. And now they ſay, becauſe I have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from ſo great a wrath, therefore will I ſing and rejoyce, and I will walke before the Lord in the Land of the living, and I will tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the Lord my deliverer, leading a life anſwerable to the love of God, beſtowing ſuch a deliverance upon me; and ſo by this preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wrath of God, as being freed from it; the more one ſeeth what he is freed from; the more he ſeeth what Chriſt hath done in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:175622:86"/>bearing that wrath for him and conſequently, the more hee is ſtirred up to walke before God in more cheerfull and com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ortable obedience, and the more thankfull hee will bee. And the more hee ſeeth what God hath done for him, the more obedience hee ſeeth hee oweth unto God.</p>
               <p>And now, if any perſons here preſent, have an evill opinion of the Grace of God as a thing of dangerous conſequence as a licentious doctrine and that it is a meanes to make men take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſin; let them learn from that which hath been ſaid, to mende their mindes, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their judgements, knowing that the Holy Ghoſt is of another minde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The main ſcope of the Apoſſle in this place, is to endeavour to take the people of God off from running into ſin. But, firſt, he uſeth an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:175622:87"/>to prevail with them which ſeems ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd unto the world, and doubtleſſe goes for little leſſe then fooliſhneſſe among men, if not worſe then fooliſhneſſe: <hi>I write to you that you fin not.</hi> Well, but how will he prevail with them? <hi>If any man ſinne we have an Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he is the propitiation for our ſinnes:</hi> As much as to ſay, this is the beſt way to prevail with you, that you ſinne not, to know before hand, that if you do ſinne, you have an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Father that will take away your faults, and ſave you harmleſſe. Indeed, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted abſurd; but this is the common ſtrain of the Goſpell, to make this the beſt argument that can be imagined, to prevaile over people from the committing of ſin, to let them know how gracious God is unto them, even to the forgiving of their ſins they ſhall commit; and that which wee noted as the main body of the Diſcourſe was this: For ſuch perſons, who have fellowſhip with the Father and the Son, to know before hand that they have an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who is the propitiation for their ſins, I ſay, to know this before hand, before they do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin, is ſo far from being the opening of the flood-gates to ſinne, that it is a ſhutting down thereof, to ſtop the courſe of ſinfulneſſe. The Holy Ghoſt is very plentifull in this very way
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:175622:87"/>of arguing to prevail with people not to ſinne, ſhewing clearly thereby, that the proclaiming of the free grace of God to men in the pardon of their ſins, and letting them know it before they doe ſin, doth not deſtroy obedience to the Law of God, but doth eſtabliſh it better than any other arguments can doe You may ſee it clearly in the 3. to the <hi>Romens</hi> 23. &amp; 24. verſes compared with verſ 31. <hi>For all have ſinned, and have come ſhort of the glory of God, being juſtified freely by his Grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to hee the propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſſe for the remiſſion of their ſinnes the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> are paſt through the forbearance of God.</hi> In theſe verſes, the Apoſtle preacheth free Grace, in the abſolute freeneſſe of it, even to perſons that are utterly undon, and know not what to doe, and in the laſt verſe of that Chapter, the Apoſtle brings in an objection: <hi>Doe wee make void the Law through faith? God forbid, we rather eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Law.</hi> The Apoſtle making his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we are juſtified by faith without the deeds of the Law; this, ſaith he, doth eſtabliſh the Law, and doth not make it void, to know, that from all the ſins we doe commit, we are freely juſtified by his Grace; this doth eſtabliſh obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and doth not make void the Law: So in the 6th Chapter of the ſame Epiſtle to the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:175622:88"/>
                  <hi>Romans,</hi> the 1. and 2. verſes, the Apoſtle having gone on to declare the exceeding riches of the Grace of God in the 4. &amp; 5. Chapters, he makes the ſame objection in ſubſtance that he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: <hi>Shall wee continue in ſinne that Grace may abound? God forbid; how ſhall wee that are dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſinne, live any longer therein?</hi> Wherein hee ſhews plainly, that though ſome may collect that this is a way to make men continue in ſin, to preach the exceeding riches of the Grace of God; yet he ſaith, there can be no ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion drawne there-from by juſt inference: <hi>How ſhall we that are dead unto ſinne, live any longer therein?</hi> Wherein he puts it to the Objectors themſelves, whether they can make it out, how it is poſſible it ſhould bee ſo. Therefore the Apoſtle doth make uſe of it, as the ſtrength of his argument to prevaile with people: In the 12. to the <hi>Romans, I beſeech you by the mercies of God, that you preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice.</hi> You ſee hee makes uſe of mercy, and what mercy is it? In the latter part of Chap. 11. he ſeems to intimate what that mercy is: <hi>O the depth and the exceeding riches, both of the Wiſdome and Knowledge of God!</hi> Why wherein? It follows, in that <hi>he hath concluded all under ſinne, that he might have mercy upon all.</hi> I beſeeeh you by theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, (ſaith he) and all other mercies of free Grace, <hi>preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:175622:88"/>acceptable unto God, not conforming your ſelves to this world:</hi> as if hee had ſaid, mercy is that which wil prevail with you moſt of al, to preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, and not conform your ſelves to the world, but I muſt go on to that we have yet to conſider. I have ſpent ſome time in Obiections and Anſwers, but wee cannot now dwell upon them. We are to conſider now the ſpecialties of the argument the Apoſtle uſeth here to prevail with people that they ſin not.</p>

Herein we are to conſider:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The matter of this argument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The force and ſtrength of it, in reference to the thing the Apoſtle would argue from hence.</p>
               <p>Firſt, concerning the matter of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe that is contained in theſe words: <hi>If any man ſin we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The force of it lies in the reference of it to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:175622:89"/>the thing the Apoſtle calls for, wherein we may conſider what prevalency this Poſition hath to keep from ſin; namely, for perſons to know, that when they doe ſin, they have an Advocate with the Father.</p>
               <p>We will begin with the matter of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment firſt, and in this Propoſition there are two things obſervable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Suppoſition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a Proviſion of indemnity againſt the miſchiefe of the thing ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>The Suppoſition laid downe, is in theſe words; <hi>If any man ſin:</hi> or, <hi>If any man do ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Proviſion of indemnity is in theſe words; <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the ſuppoſition you may note,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the thing ſuppoſed, and that is <hi>Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, note the time which doth illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it; hee doth ſpeak of preſent and future ſins.</p>
               <p>Note, I ſay, the time whereunto the Apoſtle doth refer the thing ſuppoſed; he doth not ſay, <hi>If any man hath ſinned heretofore,</hi> in the Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, but he ſpeakes of the time preſent, <hi>If any man ſin,</hi> that is, if any man doe ſin; there are ſome things that are ſpoken of the preſent time that are in force but onely that very inſtant in which they are ſpoken; and that in ſtant being paſt, the thing it ſelfe is alſo paſt. But for this
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:175622:89"/>expteſſion, <hi>If any man doe ſinne,</hi> it is not a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but a permanet expreſſion: The Apoſtle ſpeakes not only of his time, and of the people of his time, <hi>If any man ſin</hi> now; the words are not to be underſtood of that very inſtant onely, and excluſively, as having reference onely to thoſe that did ſin in his time, then theſe words ſhould have been tranſient: But the meaning of the Apoſtle is, that the preſent of which hee ſpake, ſhould bee a ſtanding preſent time, and the words ſhould be of force for preſent, even as long as the Word of God ſhould remain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on record. <hi>If any man ſin.</hi> So that the words are to bee underſtood of this preſent time, and all preſent times that ſhall bee in the next age that ſhall ſucceed: If any man ſinne now, or if any man ſin in the next age; ſo that there is to be underſtood a perpetuity of preſent time, to bee included in this expreſſion <hi>(If any man do ſinne).</hi> It is of great concernment, beloved, that you receive this truth, unleſſe you exclude your ſelves from the beneſt of the Advocateſhip of Chriſt: For, if the words were ſpoken of the preſent time, and intended only for that time wherein they were expreſſed, what ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of us, that live ſo many ages after that time? They muſt therefore be of a perpetuall and permanent being.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, note in the ſuppoſition, the nature
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:175622:90"/>of it, <hi>if any man ſinne,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; this word <hi>[If]</hi> here admits of a double conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; either the Suppoſition imports a thing poſſible, but not likely, or a thing that may be likely to come to paſſe, or rather a thing that may, and will come to paſſe. Either it is a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, in caſe a thing is, which it may bee, will not, or a ſuppoſition by way of confeſſion and granting of the thing ſuppoſed. In this place, <hi>John</hi> puts not the word <hi>If</hi> by way of ſuppoſition, as if it were onely likely there ſhould bee a ſinning? and if there were a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there were an Advocate; but he puts the word here by way of conceſſion, as if hee had ſaid, there muſt and will be ſinning; We Gods own people, ſhall fall into ſin, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. But for refuge, when there is ſuch ſinnes committed, know that there is an Advocate with the Father, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> Thus you have the firſt part of the Text branched out unto you; namely the Apoſtles <hi>Suppoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider the <hi>Proviſion</hi> that the Lord by the Apoſtle holds forth unto perſons that are Beleevers, the Members of Chriſt. I ſay, the proviſion the Lord holds out by the Apoſtle for their indempnity againſt theſe ſins that they do, or ſhall commit; namely <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Proviſion obſerve,</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:175622:90"/>
               <p>Firſt, the office aſſigned for the making good of ſuch proviſion.</p>
               <p>The office aſſigned here, is mentioned in theſe words, <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, note in this proviſion, the perſon to whom this office of Advocateſhip is given, and therein the ability and qualification of this perſon to this office to manage it effectually, in theſe words, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the iſſue and the event of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this office, in theſe words, <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the office that the Lord ſets on foot for the proviſion of indemnity againſt ſin, being committed, you may obſerve in it:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The office it ſelfe, and that is an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocateſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The propriety of this office, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it to the perſons that are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt. The Apoſtle doth not ſay ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſtractively, <hi>there is</hi> an Advocate, but he ſpeaks relatively, we have an Advocate, that is, <hi>our Advocate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this Advocate is ſet forth, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his relation to men, as he is their advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, but he is declared alſo, and ſet forth as he hath relation unto God: Hee doth not ſay ſimply, we have an Advocate; but I ſay, the Apoſtle doth declare the excellency of this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:175622:91"/>of advocateſhip in reſpect of this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>With the Father,</hi> we have an Advocate, and that <hi>with the Father,</hi> we have an Advocate he is ours, and not only ſo, but he is an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of ours which the Father, which notes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that the plea of Chriſt for indemnity from ſin, is not in any inferiour Court, where, if there bee a ſentence of acquittance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, there may be a charge from an higher Court: But the Advocateſhip of Chriſt is managed for our good, in the higheſt Court of all, with the higheſt Judge; that when hee gets a ſentence, it is definitive and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and there is no other Court that can take upon it the determination of the caſe, or call in queſtion the triall of that which hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined there.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the proviſion in reſpect of the office aſſigned, is excellently illuſtrated by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, when the office is on foot, or when the officer doth manage it. The Text doth not ſay, we had an Advocate, or we ſhall have one hereafter, but he ſpeaks in the Preſent Tenſe, <hi>We have an Advocate,</hi> that now is to agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it. It is but a cold comfort for a man to ſay, being now a begger, he had abundance of wealth, neither doth it give him fulneſſe of comfort, to ſay that he ſhall have abundance of wealth hereafter; but herein lyes his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:175622:91"/>and happineſſe, that he can ſay in truth, I am rich, I have abundance of all things. It is but cold comfort for a man, to ſay, I had a friend in Court once, but he is dead now; If he had been alive now, it had been better with me then it is, I ſhould have ſped well, I had then carried the cauſe on my ſide, hee would have done ſo and ſo for me. I, but here lies a mans comfort, that he hath a friend at Court that will doe him a good office at his need: The Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>we have an Advocate.</hi> As therefore I ſaid of the preſent being of ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; ſo I ſay of the preſent being of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate. It muſt not be underſtood to be a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient, but a permanent ſentence, it was in force in the Apoſtles time, it is as full in force in our time; and we may as well and truly ſay, <hi>Wee have an Advocate;</hi> and in after ages, the Church of God ſhall ſay, to the end of the world, in their times, as truly as we now, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in his time ſaid, <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider here the perſon mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this office of Advocateſhip, who is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto us by three admirable and notable titles, that are proper and full for the comfort and incouragement of thoſe whoſe Advocate he is: He is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> ſaith the Text, this is our Advocate. Firſt, he is <hi>Jeſus;</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:175622:92"/>and that is a word that imports a Saviour, as the Angel expounded it, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>And they ſhall call his name Jeſus, for hee ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> An admirable encouragement to lift up the heads of dejected and drooping ſpirits, when the Advocate comes to plead: this Advocate is their Saviour, that is, his plea is of ſuch force and prevalency, that he ſaves his client.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, many times in ſuits of Law, men have skilfull Lawyers to plead for them, which are able to ſave them who are not admitted to plead for them, becauſe they are not called to the Bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, but this Jeſus is Chriſt too, this Advocate doth not ruſh into this office of his own head, without warrant, but is called to it: For, as you ſhall heare afterwards, the word <hi>Chriſt</hi> imports anointing to the office. Many a good Lawyer indeed, may not be admitted to come to the bar of Common pleas, although he can plead the cauſe of his client the beſt of all, he muſt be authorized and called unto the bar, or elſe he may not ſpeak. But the Advocate provided for the indemnity againſt ſin, is Chriſt, he is called to it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is <hi>Jeſus Christ the righteus,</hi> and that imports the ſtrength of the plea hee hath, by which he becomes a propitiation for ſin, it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:175622:92"/>is his righteouſneſſe that prevails in heaven, to get the ſentence to go on the ſide of his client.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, you may obſerve here, the iſſue what will become of this Advocateſhip, what effect it will have at the laſt. Many men, who have cauſes in ſuit, are reſtleſſe to know how their cauſe will goe, when they come to triall, fain they would know on which ſide the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict will be given: and it is a great refreſhing to perſons, to know before-hand, that the cauſe will goe on their ſide. Now, the Apoſtle doth here intimate unto us, what will become of the cauſe before it is tried. He is ſuch an Advocate with the Father (ſaith hee) that hee is become the <hi>propitiation</hi> for all the ſins of Gods people, and what that is, we ſhall ſhew hereafter. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, this is a large field of excellent variety of ſweetneſſe and fatneſſe, we muſt take the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars into conſideration, that wee may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe them the more orderly; and I hope it will be no difficulty to gather ſome of the flowers in this garden, and the Spirit of the Lord aſſiſting, there may be ſucking, yea ſucking ſo, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be ſatisfied that they may <hi>ſuck and bee ſatisfied at the breſts of conſolation.</hi> That wee may the better lay our mouthes to this breaſt, and draw more eaſily the milke thereof, let us briefly conſider theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, concerning the office here ſpoken of,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:175622:93"/>we are firſt to conſider, what it is to be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, and how Chriſt doth manage this office being in heaven. I ſay, firſt, what it is to be an Advocate with the Father, and how Chriſt doth manage it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whoſe cauſe it is that Chriſt doth undertake to be an Advocate for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how Chriſt is gifted and qualified for the comfortable managing of this office of Advocateſhip.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, what it is to have Chriſt to be the propitiation for the ſinnes of his people; this I conceive contains the ſum of the whole drift of the Apoſtle in theſe words.</p>
               <p>To begin with the firſt, what the office of Advocateſhip is, and what it is for Chriſt to be an Advocate, and how hee doth now manage it in heaven for his elect.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this office to bee an Advocate, as it is appropriated unto Chriſt, I doe not finde that it is once more mentioned in all the Scripture beſides this place. Of an Interceſſor and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and the atonement we reade frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Scripture, that Chriſt is all theſe, but that Chriſt is an Advocate, we cannot finde where it is mentioned in all the Scripture but in this place, and therefore it will be the more difficult to finde out the intention of the Holy Ghoſt, what he means by this office of Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateſhip.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:175622:93"/>The word Advocate in the originall is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the ſome word is uſed by <hi>John</hi> in the 1 of <hi>John</hi> and the 26. verſe, and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Holy Ghoſt, and is there tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Comforter,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſaith the Text, <hi>The Comforter will come.</hi> Now, the ſame word that we have here <hi>Advocate,</hi> is alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And indeed, the proper ſingification of the word is, <hi>A Comfortable Advocate.</hi> But the thing it ſelf, What is this Advocateſhip, will you ſay? It is a borrowed expreſſion, and an alluſion, opening the prevalency of Chriſt with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for his owne people; it is taken from an office among men. Advocates in the Common Law, you call them Counſellors, but in the Civill Law, they have this very title of Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. The office is this; namely, being well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the nature of the Law, and the Rules and Principles of Juſtice; when ever a cauſe comes to be tried, they are to make clear the Principles of Juſtice, and ſo to plead out Juſtice on the behalfe of the client, for whom they plead. I ſay, the office of an Advocate is, to plead the cauſe of a perſon as it ſtands in equity and juſtice, and to demand and require a ſentence of acquittance and diſcharge from Juſtice and equity it ſelfe. Herein an Advocate differs from a Suppliant; a Suppliant makes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requeſts, and depends altogether upon fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:175622:94"/>alone, ſo as if hee ſhould ſtand to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of Juſtice, he muſt bee gone, and his cauſe muſt miſcarry: I ſay, this is the proper office of a Suppliant or Petitioner; but an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, hee ſtands to the juſtice of a perſon, whoſe cauſe hee doth plead, and puts the iſſue of the triall even to Juſtice it ſelfe; that as the cauſe can bee cleared to bee a juſt cauſe, ſo the Judge would paſſe a ſentence upon the cauſe: juſt ſo, I ſay, is it with Chriſt pleading the cauſe of his own people with the Father, in reſpect of indempnity from ſin; for his Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateſhip is this, namely, to lay the Law to the Father, to plead juſtice in the diſcharge of the ſinner that doth commit ſinne, that it is but right and juſtice to diſcharge him: and it were an unrighteous thing, and in juſtice, if he ſhould not; I ſay, it is moſt certainly true that Chriſt ſtands here upon juſtice, and he will in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe have God to diſcharge his own people from all the ſins that they do commit; and hee pleads that it is an unrighteous thing, to charge them with them, or to plague or puniſh them for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome peradventure, will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay, this cannot be, that Chriſt as an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, ſhould plead for indempnity upon terms of juſtice, for in the ſtrictneſſe, and the rigor of juſtice, the ſoule that ſinneth muſt die: And
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:175622:94"/>the Goſpel ſeems to ſay, it is onely and ſolely Grace that any perſon is diſcharged from ſin: For in juſtice there cannot be a claime made of pardon and diſcharge from ſin, but all the plea muſt be meerly bounty and favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This objection ſeems to have a great deale of ſtrength in it. How may theſe two things ſtand together, that Chriſt pleading ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, God muſt forgive; and yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice doth ſentence a perſon unto death, if he ſins? For anſwer to this, you muſt learn to diſtinguiſh, and I deſire you warily to obſerve this diſtinction, that ſo you may plainly ſee a reconciliation of that which ſeems impoſſible to be reconciled: I ſay, obſerve this diſtinction, namely, firſt, conſider the pardon or diſcharge from ſin, in regard of any thing laid down in conſideration of the ſin committed by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who doth partake of this pardon. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, conſider this pardon, or indemnity and diſcharge from ſin in reference unto Chriſt who gets this diſcharge. Now, I ſay, in the former conſideration, that is, in reſpect of us that do partake of this diſcharge from ſin, and in regard of any thing that we can bring in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for that ſin, or ſatisfie, in this regard it is meerly and only Grace, that ſinners being the members of Chriſt are diſcharged. When you, or I commit ſin, that God doth diſcharge
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:175622:95"/>us, that God doth not lay our ſins to us, that God doth not give ſentence of damnation upon us for ſuch and ſuch ſins as we do commit. I ſay, it is an act of meer Grace alone, Juſtice cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> pleaded in this caſe.</p>
               <p>But, ſecondly, conſider the indemnity from ſin, in reſpect of Chriſt, who doth get this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and doth purchaſe it of the Father. Then Chriſt is to bee conſidered two wayes: Firſt, as Chriſt is allowed by the Father to ſtand in the room of ſuch perſons, whoſe cauſe he pleads: Or, ſecondly, Chriſt is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as he hath actually made full payment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Father, his ſatisfaction being allowed and admitted before thereunto. Now, I anſwer, conſidering Chriſt in his being allowed by the Father, to ſtand in the room of the perſons whoſe cauſe he pleads; ſo this diſcharge from ſin by Chriſt, it is an act of Grace; Chriſt cannot plead juſtice, that he ſhould be allowed. There was not a tye upon the Father, that Chriſt ſhould bee in mans room, and that the Father ſhould be unrighteous, if hee did not ordain him to bee ſo; it was an act of free Grace in God, when men were under the curſe, and became miſerable bankrupts, that Chriſt ſhould make ſatisfaction for them: When one man doth owe another money, it is not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous act in this creditor to refuſe a ſurety,
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:175622:95"/>he may make the debtor pay the debt himſelfe, if he will; it is matter of grace, it is meer cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie ſo to doe: Even ſo it is matter of grace, that Chriſt is admitted to come in the roome of man, and to ſtand in the ſtead of man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to beare the ſins of man. For him to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to beare the wrath of God for theſe ſins that another hath committed, this is an act of grace; and in regard of theſe particulars, is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo frequent in theſe expreſſions of the free Grace of God, in communicating this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and pardon of ſin unto ſinners. But, ſecondly, conſider, Chriſt allowed of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtand in the room of men, as he hath come forth, and paid down the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that God in juſtice could demand for, or in conſideration of theſe ſins that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his people: I ſay, when Chriſt hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, or delivered up into the hands of his Father the utmoſt farthing that hee could charge upon Believers, or demand on their behalfe; this being received by the Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement being made by him, upon the receipt of what Chriſt hath paid, this, I ſay, conſidered, it is an act of juſtice and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the Father ſhould juſtifie and acquit theſe perſons, for whom he hath received of Chriſt this ſatisfaction, and accordingly hath acknowledged ſatisfaction under his own hand
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:175622:96"/>and acquitted them. You know, though it bee in a mans power and liberty whether hee will take a ſurety, or the principall for his money, yet when he hath taken a ſurety, and he hath made payment, it is an act of unrighteouſneſſe in the creditor, after the acknowledgement of full ſatisfaction, to come upon the principall again, and to make him pay the money. And it is a plea grounded in Law, that if that cauſe come in triall again, the Judge ought to acquit the principall, if it bee proved that the debt is paid by the ſurety. Now, Chriſt hath paid all that the Father could ask, and God hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged full ſatisfaction for all: <hi>He beheld the travell of his ſoule, and was ſatisfied.</hi> Now, being ſatisfied, it is an act of juſtice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, that the Father ſhould acquit a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in this kind: Suppoſe a perſon ſhould bee brought before a Judge in a cauſe wherein hee oweth the Judge himſelf ſuch a ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, and borrowed it of the Judge himſelf, an Advocate comes and pleads the cauſe before the Judge, that it is true, there was ſo much money lent, and borrowed, but, ſaith the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, I my ſelfe became the ſurety for that man, I paid every farthing, there is the acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance you gave under your own hand. Now, I ask this queſtion, the Judge being convinced, and a righteous Judge too, of the truth of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:175622:96"/>plea, whether in judgement he ought not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit that perſon, whoſe cauſe is pleaded before him? He tooke ſaits faction, he acknowledged ſatisfaction, he could have but ſatisfaction of him, therefore in juſtice he muſt diſcharge him. The ſame caſe is betweene God and us; it is true indeed, Beleevers doe commit thoſe things that are in their own nature debts: <hi>Forgive us our debts,</hi> as the word is: but when this cauſe came to be agitated, and pleaded before God the Judge himſelfe, to whom the debt was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſt the Advocate came, and ſtood up and pleaded, that he himſelfe being become the ſurety of a better teſtament, upon it he came, and paid the whole debt, and hee having ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Father, hee received under his Fathers hand, that he had paid every farthing, and that he was ſatisfied, and that upon that ſatisfaction his people ſhould be diſcharged. Now, this plea is grounded upon iuſtice it ſelfe; Obſerve but how fully and clearly the Apoſtle ſpeakes the ſame things in the 1. of <hi>John</hi> 1.7. the Apoſtle tels us expreſly, that <hi>the blood of Chriſt his Son, cleanſeth from all ſins;</hi> and here, <hi>If any man ſinne, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and hee is the propitiation for our ſins;</hi> and againe, in the former Chapter, <hi>If we confeſſe our ſinnes, God is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins.</hi> Mark well that the Apoſtle grounds
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:175622:97"/>himſelf upon Chriſts ſatisfaction; namely, his blood that doth cleanſe us from all ſin. Upon this ground hee doth conclude, that it is an act of faithfulneſſe and juſtice in God, to forgive ſinne. I dare ſay, none are ſo ignorant in theſe daies of light, as to thinke there is ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between confeſſion of ſin, and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne, that confeſſion can ballance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe, and ſo conſequently, make it an act of juſtice. No, the Apoſtle doth ground the force of juſtice upon the blood of Chriſt that is ſhed. Therfore, if you do obſerve it well, you ſhall find that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of confeſſion, by way of anticipation, or prevention of fear; you know the common Proverb in the world concerning a Malefactor apprehended, is, <hi>Let him confeſſe,</hi> ſay wee, <hi>and he ſhall be hanged.</hi> Why ſo? becauſe, if it be diſcloſed, the Law lays hold upon him, and hee ſhall be ſure to die for it; and therefore, in naturall policy, his ſafety lies in concealing of it. But now, if ſatisfaction hath beene made by a friend of his to the Law, and accordingly a pardon ſued out for him, there is no danger in his confeſſion at all. Now, the Apoſtle in this place, having before ſaid, that the blood of Chriſt his Sonne cleanſeth us from all our ſinnes, from hence he gathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement unto the people of Chriſt, that they ſhould not fear, ſo as to conceal their ſins,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:175622:97"/>leſt being known, they ſhould do them a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. But ſaith he, lay all open before the Lord, there is nodanger to be ſupected now: For God is faithfull and juſt to forgive them; therefore the hiding of them ſhould prevent no evill, becauſe no evill ſhould come upon them for them, though they were laid open never ſo naked. Therefore was this ſpoken by the Apoſtle, to take away fear; and this is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rue meaning of the Holy Ghoſt therein: I ſay, to take away fear from the damage that would enſue, if we ſhould confeſſe our ſins what they are. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> mark what he aſcribes to participating of the excellencies of Chriſt, even of righteouſneſſe and juſtice: <hi>I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſſe:</hi> Marke, <hi>a crown of righteouſneſſe is laid up,</hi> in which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the diſcharge from ſin, and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of glory, and a crown of righteouſneſſe prepared and laid up: But mark the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his confidence, that he ſhall partake of it, It is a righteous Judge that ſhall give it, he ſhall give it out of righteouſneſſe it ſelf, juſtice ſhall prevail with him to do this thing for him. Whence it is, that Chriſt is called ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Righteouſneſſe, The Lord our righteouſneſſe,</hi> as you have it in the 33. of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> a Propheſie
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:175622:98"/>concerning the righteous <hi>Branch,</hi> and his name ſhall be called, <hi>The Lord our righteouſneſſe, that</hi> is, the Lord that is righteous, makes us one with God, and doth communicate his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe unto us, that we may be the delight of the Father. Give me leave to tell you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, that God is ſo unchangeable in all his Attributes, that even Chriſt himſelf is not able to obtain any thing of the Father that may be any wayes prejudiciall to the nullifying of any attribute whatſoever; I ſay, Chriſt himſelf can get nothing of the Father, whereby his juſtice may ſuffer, or be violated. Chriſt muſt make it clear, that juſtice ſhall have its full due, and God ſhall not need to bate one grain of what juſtice doth expect, or elſe Chriſt himſelfe can have nothing of the Father: For Chriſt came not to deſtroy the Law, and ſo he ſaith him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, much leſſe did Chriſt come to deſtroy that which is eſſentiall unto God. Gods juſtice is eſſentiall unto him,: If Chriſt violate juſtice, he ſhould deſtroy the very being of God himſelfe. Therefore without giving juſtice ſatisfaction, this would be a derogation to the Father; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Chriſt doth plead with the Father for the ſons of men, that they might have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from ſin, he doth make it manifeſt that all he doth aske of the Father he doth ask ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto juſtice; nay, Chriſt makes it to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:175622:98"/>appear that juſtice is as much ſatisfied in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of Believere from their ſins, as it is in the damnation of the Reprobates in hell, for their ſins. Juſtice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> no more right in their damnation, then it hath in the others acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and diſcharge. In the damnation of the Reprobates in Hell, to ſatisfie juſtice, there is no more but the wrath of God revealed from Heaven, and executed upon them. Now for thoſe Believers that are the members of Chriſt, and are diſcharged by Chriſt from their ſins, the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, and poured out upon his Son in their behalf, who ſuſtained in reſpect of the proportion of juſtce equivalently to all the torments the Reprio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in Hell do ſuſtain. So that Chriſt hath as fully ſatisfied the juſtice of God for his elect, as it is ſatisfied in the damned in Hell, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in their own perſons. Surely there had been no need of Chriſts coming into the world, if Believers might have been ſaved, and juſtice violated without ſatisfaction: But now juſtice had been violated, had not a proportionable recompence been made before the ſin had been diſcharged from off the perſon committing the ſame. Therefore the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeake admirably, when he ſaith, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore it is but an ignorant imagination in the hearts of ſome men, that God will grow more remiſſe, in reſpect of the ſins of his own people; that God is not ſo much offended with the nature of ſin, after Chriſt died, as before: For God hath all the abhorring, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting thoughts of ſin in the nature of it, ſince Chriſt is dead, as he had before he died.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have formerly (as ſome of you may remember) entered upon theſe words; wherein the Apoſtle makes the propoſall of the Grace of God in Chriſt, the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement unto people to forbear ſin. The firſt thing we noted therefore from hence, was this: That the knowledge of an Advocate that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a propitiation for ſin, even for ſuch as do commit ſin; I ſay, the knowledge of this Grace is ſo far from opening a gap unto a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious life, that indeed, it is the beſt means and help in the world to keep us from ſinning. The laſt day we fell upon the matter of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:175622:101"/>which the Apoſtle uſeth, to diſſwade little children from ſin: <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Herein we propoſed to be conſidered,</p>
               <p>Firſt, what this Advocateſhip of Chriſt is, and how Chriſt doth manage this office of Advocateſhip.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whoſe cauſe it is that Chriſt doth here plead.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how Chriſt is gifted and qualified for this office of Advocateſhip.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, what the iſſue of this Advocateſhip of Chriſt is, propoſed in the laſt words of the Text; <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, what this office of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocateſhip is; the ſumme is briefly this. The office of an Advocate is to plead out the cauſe of a man, as it is in juſtice and right; ſo that the Advocateſhip of Chriſt conſiſts in pleading forth the diſcharge of his people, even from the principle of right and juſtice.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is objected and indeed ſeems a thing unreconcilable; namely, that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from ſin, goes all along under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace, and free Grace, and pardon, how can this be, if it be meerly an act of juſtice, for God to forgive ſins?</p>
               <p>This may eaſily be reconciled with a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; diſcharge from ſin, in reſpect of us, or
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:175622:101"/>what we can bring by way of recompence for the ſin committed, is meerly free Grace. Wee can bring nothing at all. Alſo in reſpect of Chriſt as he is allowed to ſtand in the room of us, it is Grace too. But, thirdly, Chriſt being allowed and admitted, and the Lord having taken the full payment he could ask at the hands of Chriſt, and acknowledging ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon ſuch payment; this act of Chriſt makes it an act of juſtice and right, that God ſhould forgive ſins; and therefore the Apoſtle in the firſt Chapter of this Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> tells us, <hi>That the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, cleanſeth us from all our ſins:</hi> And therefore he concludes, that <hi>he is faithfull and juſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſins.</hi> But I cannot inſiſt upon what I have formerly delivered. Now, peradventure ſome (though I confeſſe a little over-curious) deſire to underſtand how Chriſt, being now in Heaven, doth execute this office of Advocate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or in what ſenſe he is ſaid to plead the cauſe of his people. I call it a curious querie, becauſe the Scriptures are very ſparing in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the manner of Chriſts managing this office. That he is an Advocate, is cleer enough; how he doth deale with God in the execution of it, is more obſcure. Frequent mention is made indeed of Chriſts interceſſion in Heaven; <hi>be ever liveth to make interceſſion for us,</hi> as the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:175622:102"/>Apoſtle teſtifieth, <hi>he doth intercede for the Saints,</hi> ſaith the holy Goſt, yet though this be ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned, and the comfort of Gods people much laid upon this; n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ely, this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion: yet the Scriptures are very ſparing what kind of interceſſion he makes whether he prays to his Father in heaven, as he did upon earth, or no? The like I ſay o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> this buſineſſe of Advocate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Some few paſſages of Scripture there are, that will give ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſacrifices, you know, they were Chriſt in the Antitype: for all the life of ſacrifices from which perſons obtain teſtimony of God, that they are righteous; is Chriſt himſelf. And it is Chriſt in ſacrifice that ſpeaks, even when the ſacrifice it ſelfe is offered. I conceive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, beloved, as ſacrifices ſpeak in reſpect of a prevailing power they have with God, when he ſits in judgement: we are to conceive like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the Advocateſhip of Chriſt, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> nothing elſe but the ſpeaking of Chriſt, is in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:175622:102"/>ſuch a kinde managed after ſuch a manner: Chriſt ſpeaks as ſacrifice ſpeaks; for indeed, Chriſt as Advocate, pleads only as a ſacrifice form an. In the 12th Chapter of the ſame Epiſtle, and the 14. verſe, you have another expreſſion, having a little more cleerneſſe in it. <hi>We are come,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>to Mount Sion, the City of the living God, to an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Angels; and to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant, and to the blood of ſprinkling that ſpeaks better things then the blood of Abel.</hi> Here you ſee whereas the Apoſtl in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imports a voyce, or a plea in the mouth of ſacrifices, in this Chapter and verſe, he ſpeaks more plainly, and puts a voyce or plea to that which is the life of ſacrifices; namely, the blood of ſprinkling, the blood of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Wee are come unto the blood of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And this blood is that which ſpeaks bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things then the blood of <hi>Abel.</hi> You know that there was a ſtrong plea in the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> which cryed from earth to heaven, till it brought vengance upon the head of <hi>Cain.</hi> The blood of Chriſt hath a ſtronger plea, and hath a ſtronger cry, and is for better purpoſes: So that under favour (for in this I ſhall not contend much) ſo far as I can ſee, the value, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and deſert and preciouſneſſe of the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of Chriſt, that is the plea that Chriſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:175622:103"/>makes as Advocate in heaven; that when a Believer doth commit ſin, the efficacy of this blood-ſhed is freſh in the pretence of the Lord, in the behalfe of that poore wretch that hath thus ſinned; I ſay, the blood is preſent, and the whole efficacy, power and vertue of that blood is freſh in the thoughts of the Lord. And as it is thus effectuall and powerfull, it procures the diſcharge, and brings the diſcharge and acknowledgement of the Lord to his thoughts too, (if I may ſo ſpeak) whereby he is pacified towards them, and pleaſed with them. This is alwayes before him, and preſent with him; yea; preſent before him, when the ſins that a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever commits are preſent; and the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea of the value of the blood of Chriſt, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the naturall plea of the ſin it ſelfe. But I will not dwell upon this, but rather haſten to a ſecond thing very conſiderable, which is,</p>
               <p>Whoſe cauſe it is that Chriſt doth plead with the Father: or, for whom the value and vertue of his blood doth plead. I remember the Diſciples when Chriſt ſpake generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his betraving, were very inquiſitive. <hi>Is it I,</hi> ſaith one? <hi>Is it I,</hi> ſaith another? I doubt not, but in regard of the prevalency, of the plea of the blood of Chriſt, many perſons preſent will fal upon this inquiry: Is it I that he means? is he my Advocate? Am I his client to plead
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:175622:103"/>my cauſe? I ſhall endeavour to make it cleer, and to reſolve it, is the Apoſtle doth here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it.</p>
               <p>The plea that Chriſt puts up for the perſons whoſe c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here the Apoſtle ſpeaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:175622:104"/>there is an Advocateſhip of Chriſt for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers finning, without exception. I know it is too frequent among many, that more groſſe ſins then ordinary in a Believe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But let me tell you, to the everlaſting conſolation of Gods people, that there is no ſin which a Believer can commit, which can exclude him from the benifit of this Advocateſhip, or bring him beyond the bounds of this large grant: <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father.</hi> And if it be <hi>any man,</hi> you will ſay, it extends to all men in the world, as well as Believers, if any man ſin. Nay, there is a reſtraint in the words, and you ſhall eaſily ſee it: If any man ſin, <hi>we have</hi> an Advocate with the Father. If any of us that have fellowſhip with the Father and the Son: it is not every one that hath Chriſt for an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, but thoſe that are Believers. Thoſe that have right to fellowſhip with the Father and the Son, are only ſpoken of in this place.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:175622:104"/>I ſpeak this, to the end that thoſe, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

He is an Advocate, he is a propitiation for every ſin of his. The words run in the generall to the end: <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſay, he is not an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for ſuch and ſuch, but for ſuch and ſuch Believers, that ſin ſo, and ſo; if they commit ſin ſo and ſo agravated, and if their ſins riſe to ſuch an height, there is no propitiation for them. But the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the generall ſtyle; <hi>If any man ſin,</hi> and he is the propitiation for <hi>our ſins;</hi> and yet, beloved, I muſt be bold to goe a little further in reſpect of the perſons whoſe cauſe Chriſt doth plead, and in whoſe behalf Chriſt is an Advocate; I ſay, it is for all ſorts of Believers; nay, I go further, it is for more then preſent Believers, even for ſome who are not for the preſent Believers, but remaine as yet in a ſtate of unbelief. In brief, Chriſt is the Advocate of the cauſe of euery perſon in the world, for whom he paid the price of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, whether they be perſons already called, or perſons not yet acquainted with the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:175622:105"/>Grace of God: for every Elect perſon, as well unconverted, as converted, Chriſt doth equalty, in reſpect of the ſubſtance of his plea, interpoſe; but when I ſay he plead; as well for the unconverted, as for the converted, I mean for ſuch unconverted perſons, as do belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the election of Grace, and have their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the price of his blood. Beloved, for mine own part, I cannot yet conceive any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable difference, between the plea of Chriſt for the converted perſons, and the Elect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, but this circumſtantiall difference; namely, that the value of his blood is equally of force, to Believers and unbelievers, being elected, ſaving that the Belevers have this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, that the Lord Chriſt pleads for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of this diſcharge unto this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perſon, but pleads not for the preſent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation there of unto the unconverted elect perſon, tell ſuch time as he ſhall be called to the faith, and by that faith, that thing be made evident which before was hid: I ſay, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin by the blood of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God doth add never a tittle of pardon it ſelf more to him that is a Believer, then to that perſon not yet converted to the faith, in regard of the ſubſtance of the pardon
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:175622:105"/>it ſelf. For the cleering of this to you; I beſeech you note what is the riſe or ground-work of the pardon of ſin. Secondly, note when this pardon of ſin is compleat with God. Theſe two things conſidered, you ſhal perceive that all the pardon, in reſpect of the ſubſtance of it, that God paſſeth over unto men, he doth paſſe it over before their converſion. Look, I ſay, upon the riſe; the true riſe, or originall of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, is the gracious grant of God, upon the blood of Chriſt ſhed. This is the onely foundation of pardon; I ſay, Gods gracious grant upon the ſheding of the blood of Chriſt, there is no pardon appliable to any perſon in the world, but what pardon is to be found in the word of Grace. Thou that art a Believer at preſent, thou haſt the pardon of thy ſins in thy ſpirit, thou art aſſured of it; Where hadſt thou this pardon? Didſt thou not fetch it out of the word of Grace? Then as ſoon as the word of Gods Grace was firſt publiſhed, this Grace of the pardon of ſin was held forth. If thou foundeſt it not here, thou found'ſt it ſome where elſe; but tell me, where will you have this Grant of God to build upon, if you will not have it in the word of Grace? You will ſay, the Spirit of God will reveale it unto you. It is true indeed; but if the Spirit of the Lord doth reveal a grant to you of Grace, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                  </gap> Grace to men, ſpeakes no otherwiſe but according to this word of Grace in men; and if that there be a contradiction between the inward voyce, and this word of Grace, that is enough to give you cauſe of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion; yea, you may be confident, that that voice within you, in reſpect of ſuch contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a falſe voyce; <hi>I</hi> ſay, that the Lord Chriſt ſends us unto his Word, and from the word we take out the pardon of ſin we have. Now, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I beſeech you conſider, if all pardon to all the Elect to the end of the world be contained in this word of Grace, there is no more pardon then what is written there; then it muſt needs follow, that God paſſed over his act of pardon of ſin at that inſtant, when he entred this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the volume of his Book. Is there no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don till thou art converted and called? then the pardon of all thy ſins are not to be found in this word of Grace, becauſe this word of Grace was written before thy converſion: So that either you muſt deny the pardon that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and truly revealed in the word of Grace and muſt ſeek out ſome newer then is revealed, or you muſt acknowledge the pardon that is granted unto men, is in regard of the ſubſtance of it, as I ſaid, as ſoon as he had left it in the volume of his Book. So that it is plain, that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:175622:106"/>as Believers coming to believe, fetch out of this word of Grace their pardon; ſo unconverted perſons elected, have their Grace equally in this word, only the Lord hides the publication of it to them, till ſuch time as he is pleaſed to call them, and give them faith to read their portion here, as other Believers have read theirs before. Its true indeed, though the pardon of every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted elect perſon be equally paſſed over by the Lord, yet till the converſion of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he gives no more hint of it to ſuch perſons than he gives to the Reprobates themſelves. This is that wil take away the ſuſpected incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies that may follow upon the pardon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready granted before converſion: For whereas men may think this will make unconverted men preſume, to know their pardon before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: I ſay, it is true, there is ſuch a pardon for him, but he knowes it not, nor ever ſhall he know it, till he be brought out of darkneſſe to the glorious light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Otherwiſe how can it be true, that all the ſins of Gods people, paſt, preſent, and to come, are all of them at once pardoned, as the godly learned <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay? I ſay, how can this be true, except there be pardon paſſed before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion? Whence ſhall a Believer coming to believe, fetch all his comfort, that all his ſins, while he was in rebellion were pardoned, if
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:175622:107"/>there were not a grant of this pardon extant before; upon which, as upon a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his believing might ſtay it ſelf? How comes it to paſſe, that perſons are not cut off before they are called; if their ſins are not pardoned, which ſtand between the wrath of God and them? Nothing elſe but the blood of Chriſt ſtands between them, even between the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying wrath of God, and Gods people that do commit ſin, even before converſion. In a word, where will you finde a new act of God ſince the grants that are regiſtered here in the Book of God? Certain I am, that the perſons pardoned were not converted, when this was made: And if there be, or come after this was firſt made, a new grant. either it muſt be entred a new here, or it muſt be in a new book by it ſelf. If therefore all the pardons are as ancient as this record is, then all pardons whatſoever are ancienter then the preſent believing of any perſon that now liveth. Hence we may let perſons know, that it is but a raſh expreſſion to ſay that ſuch and ſuch a perſon is in the ſtate of damnation (if it be meant he is ſo before God) while he remains in the ſtate of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and the wrath of God abides upon that perſon, though elected, till he be called.</p>
               <p>Beloved, let me tell you, the ſtate of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted elected perſon, is as ſure from danger
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:175622:107"/>of finall miſcarriages as the eſtate of a Saint in glory; Saints in glory ſtands in glory by the blood of Chriſt alone, the ſame blood hath purchaſed the pardon of ſin for the unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, elect perſon; ſo that the ſame dicharging of them, by the blood of Chriſt, concerns the one as much as it doth another. But I ſay, ſtill the unconverted perſon cannot make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions from all this, becauſe he cannot know his portion till he come to believe.</p>
               <p>The third thing I propoſed, is to know how Chriſt is qualified and gifted to ſuch a vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as this is: His office is of admirable uſe to men. To be a propitiation for the ſins of men, and to get the diſcharge of God manifeſted to a perſon for whom he doth plead, it is of great conſolation. So then it muſt needs be that the Counſel or Advocate that is to plead the cauſe be wel gifted for that imployment. It is too wel known, that a righteous cauſe many a time miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carries in the world through the deceitfulneſſe or ſimplicity of the Counſel. When mon come upon life and death, it concerns them much to have a skilfull Lawyer to plead for them, or elſe for lack of urging that which is moſt neceſſary to be pleaded, the men miſcarry and periſh. The Holy Ghoſt therefore, beloved, is pleaſed to import unto us, not onely that Chriſt is an Advocate, and whoſe cauſe it is that Chriſt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:175622:108"/>doth plead; but alſo doth communicate unto us the largeneſſe of the gifts of Chriſt, for the managing of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffice. I will not go beyond the Text it ſelfe, to communicate to you the fulneſſe of the gifts of Chriſt, to manage this Advocateſhip of his, even to that effect and iſſue that is heart can deſire, that is, more then thy heart can deſire. There are three titles, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated in this place unto Chriſt, all of them very aptly and ſweetly manifeſting, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts of Chriſt, as Mediator, or as advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for, or on the behalf of poore believers, to wit, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus the righteous;</hi> We have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> every title ſhews how he is gifted.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the title <hi>Chriſt,</hi> contains much in it to ſtrengthen our confidence in this our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell that is to plead our cauſe Chriſt is a word that properly ſignifies anointed, and is derived from a word which hath the ſame ſignification in it. Now, anointing, if you remember well, carries two things along with it:</p>
               <p>The firſt is, the ſeparation or calling of ſuch a perſon anointed to ſome ſpeciall office.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing imported by it is, the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and gifts of the perſon for the office he is called unto. So that our Advocate being Chriſt and called Chriſt here, this imports unto us: firſt, the lawfull authorizing and calling of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:175622:108"/>Chriſt unto it, by him that doth indeed, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize him: Secondly, the full and large abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities Chriſt hath to manage it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, the title <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth import un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, Chriſts lawfull call to plead: You know what the Apoſtle ſaith in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, No man taketh this honour unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he that is called of God, as was</hi> Aaron. Where he further cleers up, how Chriſt was called, and lawfully called unto it: <hi>The Lord hath ſworn,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>and will not repent, Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of</hi> Melchiſedec; Here is his calling. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> what moment is this, will you ſay? I anſwer, of great moment, Let Chriſt be never ſo able to plead, except the Lord admit him to plead, he muſt hold his tongue: You know in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law it ſelf, there are Students in the Law, and there are Counſellors; then Sergeants at Law; the Students in the Law, it may be, are more able to plead a cauſe, and can doe it better then ſome Sergeant at Law, or ſome others that are called; but yet becauſe he is not called, he, muſt hold his tongue. Beloved, were Chriſt our Advocate a Novice, and not graduated, if he were not called to the Bar, though he can plead never ſo excellently with God, he could not be heard, God will give a call before he heare. So Chriſt is called.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:175622:109"/>
               <p>Yet again, when men are called to be Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, yet they cannot plead at every Bar. At the Common-pleas, none plead but a Sergeant at law; though many Counſellors be able Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, &amp; better gifted then ſome Sergeants, yet this will not ſuffice, he is not called to that Bar in ſpeciall, and therefore they muſt not come till they have the cal as the Sergeants have. The Lord doth not bid us to ſeek his face without a Mediator, but he that is the Advocate at the Court of Heaven is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that is, one Man, the Man Chriſt. He that hath the beſt Rethoricke in the world to plead his cauſe muſt have him as a Sergeant to plead for him; he cannot be admitted into this Court to plead for himſelf. The Miniſters of God are in ſome ſort the pleaders of our cauſe, yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves muſt have this Sergeant to plead for them when they come to this tribunall of God, and he alone is admitted to it. And it is a great matter to know what kinde of Chriſt he is, that is ſingled out; and then you muſt know, that if all the world offer this ſervice unto you to plead your cauſe before God, it would not avail, if this Man Chriſt were not freely aſſign'd and called to plead your cauſe; you are gone for ever, nothing in the world can be heard but Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> You will ſay, the ſervants of God are heard when they pray.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:175622:109"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſay, Chriſt is onely heard when he Prayes; you muſt pray in faith, ſaith <hi>James, Let him not think that he ſhall obtaine any thing at the hand of the Lord that wavers;</hi> he muſt ask in faith, that is, he muſt ask in Chriſt, for faith reſts not upon it ſelf, but upon Chriſt. It is Chriſt gets every thing for men, it is not they themſelves, nor their prayers, but it is Chriſt that prevails. Now, this Advocate Chriſt, he ſpeaks his minde, and is admitted to ſpeak his minde to the full: But this is not all, Chriſt is gifted and qualified that he may plead effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: There may be ſome unrighteous Judge in the world, that may call men for favour, as a father calls his ſon, whether he be gifted and qualified or no, that is not regarded. This man for ſome by-reſpects, ſhall come to the Bar, but God is a righteous Judge, a Judge that hath no partiality: Chriſt indeed is his Son, but Chriſt his Son is not called meerly for favour, but as he calls his Son, ſo he breeds his Son: You know, beloved, that at the Inns of Court, the Judges, and primeſt Lawyers, are teachers of Students, and when they finde them to be proficients, then they call them, and admit them to the Bar. So Chriſt is the Student, and the Father, he doth inſtruct and tutor him, he breeds him up, if I may ſo ſpeak, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, to be fit for the Advocateſhip, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:175622:110"/>then when he was fit, he put him out unto it. You ſhall find anointing, as in the word Chriſt to import gifting of men, when they are called out: <hi>Aaron,</hi> he was anointed, he was gifted to make atonement: and ſo of <hi>Saul,</hi> when <hi>Samuel</hi> anointed him, the Text ſaith, <hi>God gave him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi> he gave him a regall <hi>heart,</hi> and when hee made him a King, he gave him the heart of a King, he gave him a kingly ſpirit. And this was that which <hi>Solomon</hi> prayed for, when the crown was ſet upon his head, that God would give him a wiſe and underſtanding heart, to goe in and out before his great people, and the Lord anſwered him, and gave him wiſdome; ſo that there was none before him, nor after him like unto him: Even ſo God did with Chriſt, he was anointed to be our Advocate, and as he anointed him, he gifted him for it, as he ſaith, <hi>I have laid help up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one that is mighty.</hi> Chriſt is the perſon that muſt bring help, and therefore his perſon ſhall be mighty. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. verſ. 18. you ſhall ſee there, that God did gift Chriſt, when he called him forth: <hi>Thou art aſcended up on high, thou haſt led captivity captive, and received gifts for men.</hi> Here the office of Chriſt is to deliver cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and for this purpoſe muſt be gifted, if he be not qualified unto it, he will fail in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it. The Apoſtle recites the ſame paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:175622:110"/>but above all, that place in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 42. and the 2, 3, 4, 5. verſes, doth manifeſtly cleer this matter, <hi>Behold my ſervant,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>mine elect, in whom my ſoule delighteth, hee ſhall not fail, neither ſhall he be diſcouraged; I will hold him with my right hand, he ſhall not be diſmayed,</hi> (ſaith the Text). Here you ſee in the words, how many expreſſions the Lord uſeth, to ſhew how he qualifieth his Son Chriſt, that ſo he may be fit to manage his buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>But further, in the ſecond place, he is not only called Chriſt, but he is Chriſt <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſaith the Text, and the title doth further illuſtrate the excellency of Chriſts qualifications to be an Advocate; Here is Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is a name importing the effectuall prevalency of Chriſt in his plea. I will not ſtand to cleer the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by the Etymologie of the word, but for a more ſenſible underſtanding of it, the word is taken up, and examined by the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, in <hi>Mat</hi> 1. verſe 21. when the Angel brings the tidings of his birth, he gave his name, <hi>They ſhall call his name</hi> Jeſus; <hi>for hee ſhall ſave his people from their ſins. Jeſus</hi> is as much as to ſay, a <hi>Saviour</hi> of people from ſin. Now, ſee how admirably our Saviour is qualified: hee hath not only Rethorick &amp; Law at his fingers ends, as we ſay, but he hath an admirable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency in his Rethorick. There is not any
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:175622:111"/>cauſe that Chriſt yet took in hand, that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried; not any client that ever Chriſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, that at any time was caſt, but he that pleads is ſtill the Saviour of his people. This <hi>Jeſus</hi> pleads ſo, that he ſaves them from their ſins. It is admirable to conſider; let the ſins produced againſt a perſon be never ſo many, never ſo hainous; let the witneſſes come in, and ſwear never ſo punctually, and prove never ſo fully the crimes committed againſt ſuch a Law; yet ſuch is the faculty of this Advocate with the Father, that he is Jeſus, that hee ſtops the judgement, the ſentence cannot goe forth. This Chriſt as he is <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> is firſt the baile of mens perſons, till the day of payment. You know the nature of bail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perſons ſhould go to priſon preſently upon the treſpaſſe, but bail takes men off till judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be given, or perfect ſatisfaction be made: As wee have ſinned, ſo in legality wee ought to lie by it preſently; but Chriſt comes before hand, even the Advocate, and paſſeth his word for theſe perſons, that there ſhall be currant payment in due time, binding himſelf body for body, that there ſhall be appearance at the day; but that is not all, when the day is come, though moſt witneſſes prove point-blanck the crime objected, and the Law pleads the juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of the puniſhment provided in that behalf,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:175622:111"/>yet this Advocate ſteps in, and payes all the Law can demand: I my ſelf have ſatisfied the Law on their behalf, ſaith he, therefore there can be no more asked of them. This you know, that if a man have borrowed an hundred pounds, and he be ſued never ſo violently, and witneſſes come in, and prove the debt never ſo cleerly, yet if a ſurety comes in, and enters bond for him, yea and payes the debt for him, if he hath been diſcharged, &amp; hath an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſatisfaction made on the behalf of that perſon, then there is no judgement comes out againſt that perſon that borrowed the mony, though the thing be proved. This is the caſe with our Advocate, he is the Surety of <hi>a better Teſtament,</hi> and pleading, when matter of fact is proved, and the Law ſpeakes directly againſt it, and juſtice pleads for ſuch a penalty to be inflicted; yet then is the Saviour produced that makes currant and full payment. There could not be expected any ſtopping of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for the client, by pleading for them, but there muſt firſt be a ſatisfying of all: This is the Saviours office, and as a Saviour, ſo he is the ſatisfier.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this Advocate is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous;</hi> and this title imports two things to us, and they are very conſiderable; and they have either reſpect unto us, or they have reſpect
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:175622:112"/>unto God, and both of them ſhew, how admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably Chriſt is gifted, how ſufficiently he is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified: For this office of Advocateſhip, as it hath reference unto us, he is <hi>Chriſt Jeſus the righteous;</hi> as much as to ſay, the true and faithfull. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and righteouſneſs are taken for one and the ſame thing, for dealing truly with perſons. Many a one loſeth a goodcauſe for the unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of his Counſel, they make againſt their clients for bribes, and play on both ſides; they deal not honeſtly with men, they carry the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a dilative way, they will not diſpatch the ſuit, they have all the arguments of delay: But this your Advocate, and our Advocate, is the righteous Advocate, the faithfull and true witneſs, he dealeth ingenuouſly and uprightly; this one you may truſt, and put all things into his hand. Many times men put their whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into their Counſels hands, to ſink or ſwim. But here is an Advocate that is faithfull, here is no danger of ſinking, you may put all into his hands, you need not fear at all, he is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and faithful Chriſt, the faithfull Advocate. But the principal thing I intended in this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, is that wherein the ſtrength of his argument lieth, that he doth plead in the behalf of his client, that is, the Advocate Chriſt is ſo righteous, that this very righteouſneſs of his ſhall carry the cauſe on your ſide, even to a full
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:175622:112"/>dicharge, even from all ſins whatſoever Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the whole ſecurity of perſons from wrath and Hell, from ſin and death, hangs upon this one hinge of his <hi>righteouſneſſe.</hi> As there is force enough in his righteouſneſſe, ſo the cauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers on the clients ſide; if that ſhould fail, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world can uphold the cauſe. It will be therefore of mighty concernment to conſider Firſt, how cleere the Scripture is, that layes all the burthen of the task in pleading upon his righteouſneſſe, and further, to conſider what kind of righteouſneſſe of Chriſt that is, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſuch a ſtrength in Chriſts pleading for his people. Both of them need to be cleered, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the latter paſſage. For the firſt, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will be cleer of themſelves, only the latter paſſage, what kinde of righteouſnes it is that hath that prevalency, is to be made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. A righteouſneſſe, and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe moſt grant; but ſome miſtake there is in the mindes of ſome people, that reach not the height of the Goſpel, what that righteouſneſs is, that hath ſuch a prevalency. The preſent time will not give me leave to handle it fully; and I will not doe it by halves, and therefore I will leave it to another time.</p>

               <p>Firſt, I ſay, of all Believers, he calls them little children, as well as ſtrong men, even the cauſe of little children, even when they have ſinned without limitation of this ſin, they ſhall commit: For he doth expreſſe himſelf in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall terms, it is the cauſe of thoſe that do ſin: <hi>If any man ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the cauſe, not only of preſent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, but alſo the cauſe of all the Elect, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers or unbelievers, if they be elected. It is true, they ſhall believe in time, but yet, I ſay, Chriſt is an Advocate of them, while unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, if they be elected. There is not a ſin in the world, but as it is damnable in its own nature, in the rigour of juſtice, ſo it doth not allow of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:175622:114"/>any forbearance; it is only Chriſt that makes the forbearance, evun untill they are called. Then we came to conſider how Chriſt our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate is qualified to manage this office with that efficaciouſneſs and ſucceſſe to the comfort of thoſe whoſe cauſe he doth maintain. The qualifications of Chriſt are expreſſed in three things in the Text.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the title, he is anointed to be an Advocate, he hath a lawfull call to the Bar; nay, he is priviledged, there is none to plead but himſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is <hi>Chriſt, anointed,</hi> that is, gifted, and made an able Miniſter: in the 42. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the beginning of the Chapter: in the 1. <hi>v.</hi> the Lord tells us, how he ſhall not be diſmayed, he will hold him up, and, ſaith the Text, <hi>There the Iſles ſhall wait for his Law;</hi> we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it two wayes: <hi>The Iſles ſhall wait for his Law,</hi> that is, the Iſles ſhall now be directed and guided by him as their Law-giver: or, we may underſtand it thus, he ſhall be ſo good a Lawyer, that the Iſles ſhall waite for his Law, as much as to ſay: If a man have a cauſe to be tried, he heares of a good Counſell, and a Lawyer very expert in the Law, ſuch a man waits for ſuch a mans Law, he waits for the Law out of his mouth, he hopes he will plead his cauſe ſo well, that it ſhal go well with him.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:175622:115"/>God makes Chriſt ſo good a Lawyer, that when he comes to plead his Law, he ſhall carry the ſentence on his clients <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Firſt, I ſay, the Scripture, or rather the Holy Ghoſt, in the word of Grace, holds forth this
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:175622:116"/>truth frequently unto us, that all the ſtrength of the plea with God, and conſequently all the ground of ſolid comfort unto us, doth wholy depend upon the righteouſnes of Chriſt and nothing elſe: Look into <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.5. &amp; 6. verſes; for <hi>David</hi> even in his time, was marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cleer in this truth: <hi>Gather my Saints,</hi> ſaith the Lord in that Pſalm, <hi>ſuch as have made a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with me by ſacrifice, and the heavens ſhall declare his righteouſneſſe.</hi> Gather them together, that is, bring them to judgement, ſuch as have made a covenant with me by ſacrifice, and then when they ſtand in Judgement, <hi>The heavens ſhall declare his righteouſneſſe.</hi> The Text doth not ſay, <hi>the heavens ſhall declare</hi> my <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> though that alſo is a truth, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens do declare both Gods and Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: Gods in paſſing ſentence of abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Chriſts pleading ſo for this ſentence that God in juſtice cannot but paſſe, the ſentence: <hi>The heavens ſhall declare his righteouſnes,</hi> ſaith the Text. Either underſtand it thus, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that ſhall be pleaded, is the righteouſneſs that comes down from heaven, of which wee ſhall ſpeak more hereafter: or thus, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which Chriſt ſhall plead, ſhall be ſo cleer and evident in the prevalency of it, that the Sun in the Firmament, the Sun in Heaven hath not a cleerer brightneſſe in it, then this
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:175622:116"/>righteouſneſſe ſhall have to cleer up the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Gather my Saints together <hi>that have made a covenant with me by ſacrifice,</hi> ſaith the Text. What ſacrifice, will you ſay, or what is there in ſacrifice, that the Lord ſhould be in covenant with his people? Look into the 51. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 19. you ſhall there ſee what there is in ſacrifice that makes a covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his people: <hi>Then ſhalt thou be pleaſed,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, with the ſacrifice of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe;</hi> righteouſneſſe in the ſacrifice, is that which doth procure a pleaſedneſs in God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe perſons, unto whom ſacrifice doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, or for whoſe uſe ſacrifice doth ſerve; I ſay, righteouſneſſe in the ſacrifice, not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteouſneſſe in the typicall ſacrifice it ſelf: For, ſaith the Apoſtle, it is impoſſible that the <hi>blood of Buls and Goats ſhould take away ſin.</hi> But there is a righteouſneſſe that is declared from Heaven, and annexed to the ſacrifice, the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, this is that which puts an end to the quarrel, this is that which makes an agreement between thoſe that are at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: And in the 51. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and the 14. <hi>verſe,</hi> you ſhall ſee, beloved, <hi>David</hi> hath ſuch a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and doth ſo make it his refuge, as that in the greateſt of ſins as he was ever overtaken with, he betakes himſelf unto that, <hi>Deliver me, O Lord, from

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:175622:118"/>by it, that he ſhall be ſure to carry the cauſe in the behalf of his client, when he pleads it; he knows ſo much, I ſay, of the prevalency of his righteouſneſſe, that he is ſure he ſhall carry the cauſe for their juſtification, when they come to their triall. In the 59. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and 16. <hi>verſe,</hi> you have an excellent expreſſion; there the Lord, ſaith the Text, wondered that there were none, that he could finde never an <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,</hi> therefore, as it follows, <hi>my arm hath brought ſalvation.</hi> But how doth his arm bring ſalvation? <hi>my righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſo it follows, <hi>it ſuſtained me.</hi> Obſerve it well, there is none in the world to deal with God on the behalf of men, but the Son of God, Chriſt himſelf, there could not one come in to help him.

                  </gap> upon the righteouſnes of Chriſt for ſecurity and comfort, is a new thing, but was knows, and was a refuge from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks more clearly then any of the reſt, I ſhall inſtance but in two paſſages, for the truth is, all the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles are full of the thing. The ſtrength of the plea of Chriſt in the behalf of his people ſinning doth ſtand in his righteouſneſſe: For this purpoſe, look into the 3. Chapter to the <hi>Remans,</hi> in the begioning of which Chap. you ſhall ſee how mightily the Spoſtl pleads to the convincing of all the world of ſin, and the fruit
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:175622:120"/>of that ſinfulneſſe, you ſhall finde from the 13. verſe forwards, a deſcription of the ſins of men. In the 20. verſe he makes a concluſion: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the deeds of ehe Law ſhal no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight.</hi> Now, after he had taken off all that might poſſibly be in man towards his reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and refuge, all that poſſible might be in the Law for the people to reſt in, he begins to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the foundation, upon which the ſafety &amp; deliverance, and ſecurity of Gods people, doth indeed depend: But now, ſaith the Apoſtle in v. 21. <hi>The righteouſneſſe of God without the Law, is manifeſt, being witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets even the righteouſneſſe of God, which is by faith in Ieſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all that doe believe; for there is no difference, for all have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely by his Grace, through the redemption that is in Ieſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſſe for the remiſſion of ſins, to declare his righteouſneſſe at this time, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of thoſe that doe believe in Ieſus.</hi> You ſee here is an inculcating again and again, that it is a righteouſneſſe; namely, his righteouſneſſe, which God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation, that is, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, to declare his righteouſneſſe, ſaith the Apoſtl, <hi>upon all,</hi> imports unto us the ſole refuge
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:175622:120"/>for the remiſſion of ſins, is only the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt: Look alſo into the 5. of the <hi>Romans</hi> 18. &amp; 19. verſes, <hi>As by one mans diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience manywere made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one, many ſhall be made righteous</hi> Our tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are the iſſue which <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience brought forth, that obedience of one man is our ſecurity, and deliverance from Hell, and death, which one mans diſobedience brought into the world; all of it is fruſtrated and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated by the obedience of one, and by the righteouſneſſe of that one: Nothing but the obedience and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt ſetting perſons free from the fruits of unrighteouſneſſe and diſobedience in <hi>Adam,</hi> is able to make them righteous. I hope, by this time, the truth is cleered enough, that there is nothing to be mentioned but only his righteouſneſs, nothing can hold water, nothing can hold plea but this righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. You ſhall therefore conſider out of all theſe paſſages what that righteouſneſſe is that hath efficacy and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency with the Father, for the diſcharge of a member of Chriſt when he ſins.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you ſhall ſee this negatively.</p>
               <p>Secondly, poſitively; and therein we ſhall endeavour to declare what righteouſneſſe of Chriſt that is that doth relieve us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, negatively; there is not any righteonſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:175622:121"/>of a Believer which he acts, which can poſſibly have any force in plea with the Father for the diſcharge of a perſon that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a ſin; I ſay, no righteouſneſs of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which he acts, and I mention that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which he doth act, becauſe the very righteouſneſſe of Chriſt it ſelf, is indeed the righteouſneſſe of a Believer: For, he is our righteouſneſſe, <hi>The Lord our righteouſneſſe,</hi> as you have heard. As he was made ſin for us, and became our ſin by impuration, ſo we are made the righteouſneſſe of God in him, that is, Chriſts righteouſneſſe is as much become our own righteouſneſſe, as our ſins became Chriſts ſins: And as Chriſt bare the whole fruit of our ſins, by being made ſin for us; ſo we enjoy the whole fruit of Chriſts righteouſneſs by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made righteous in him; therefore I ſay not ſimply no righteouſneſſe of a Believer, but no righteouſneſs of a Believer which himſelf doth act, hath the leaſt force in plea to prevaile for the diſcharge of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:175622:121"/>force or power of plea with the Father to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him for your righteouſneſſe, for your diſcharge, or to move him to give the ſentence upon you, that you are diſcharged. No righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, I ſay, whatſoever you can doe: For the beſt righteouſneſſe that ever man did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, Chriſt only excepted, hath more in it to make againſt the perſon that did it, then it hath to make for him to obtain a ſentence of diſcharge; and my reaſon is this: In the beſt righteouſneſſe of man, in turning from ſin, or in repenting or mourning, or what ever elſe there is to be thought of, there is abundance of ſin, even in the very beſt actions that are performed. And where there is ſinfulneſſe, there is a plea againſt the perſon; ſo that if you bring that righteouſneſſe to plead with God, to prevail with him, you bring that which may be objected againſt you, and may prove a ſtrong plea to mar the cauſe that is in hand. I beſeech you, beloved, obſerve the Apoſtle in the 7th Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where, I think, I ſhall meet with theſe things, which moſt people in ignorance do moſt commonly make their chiefeſt plea, whereon they build their own comforts, and their whole comforts, as if all were well between God and them thereby; yet you ſhall their finde, how the Apoſtle, though qualified in that manner, as he was, doth both
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:175622:122"/>renounce any ſuch plea, and alſo doth betake himſelf to that plea we are now in hand with: The Apoſtle ſaith there expreſly, <hi>To will is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I finde not: I delight in the Law of God, in the inner man, but in the mean while, there is a law in my members, rebelling againſt the law of my minde, and leading me captive to the law of ſin;</hi> out of all which principles, obſerve, I beſeech you, theſe particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Apoſtle, though he did ſee he fell through infirmitie, yet he cleerly perceived his heart was upright towards God; ſo that he ſaid, <hi>To will is preſent with me, the good that I would doe, that doe I not; and the evill that I would not doe, that do I.</hi> Though the Apoſtle was overtaken, yet his heart was towards God ſtill: when he did evill, his heart ſaid plainly, It is not with my conſent; when he could not do good, his heart told him, it was for lack of power, and not becauſe he did not deſire it. Now, come to perſons that walk exactly, as the Apoſtle did, they are overtaken with a ſin; what is there comfort when they do ſin? though I be overtaken, the frame of my heart is right ſtill, my heart is ſincere towards God, my heart is right, it is directly contrary to my diſpoſition, I do not do that evill I do with a full bent of my ſpirit; and in regard my heart is thus right,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:175622:122"/>there is comfort to me, though I have ſinned: Suppoſe your ſpirits were in that frame the Apoſtles was in at that time, I ask but this, Do you not draw comfort ſtill from the plea of this diſpoſition your ſpirits do make? When you have committed a ſin, do you not fetch comfort from thence? Ask your hearts, and they will anſwer, yea, we have done ſo, and we may do ſo. I beſeech you conſider it well, when the Apoſtle had argued the caſe thus, what was the finall concluſion, and the ſole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge that he doth flie unto, or the plea that he would truſt unto for his deliverance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? He doth not ſay in the concluſion, <hi>I thank God, to will is preſent with me,</hi> I thank God, my heart is in a good frame and temper, though I was overtaken; I ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not make uſe of this plea, but he betakes himſelf to this, <hi>I thank G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chapter to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> you ſhall heare the Apoſtle,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:175622:123"/>towards the beginning of the Chapter, plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame thing there, as he did here; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is not any righteouſneſſe that he can reach unto, that he dare venture the plea upon, or his own comfort upon: Firſt, he tells us, that <hi>touching the righteouſneſſe of the Law, he was blameleſſe.</hi> This was before his converſion, you will ſay? It is true; but after his converſion, he tells us alſo of a righteouſneſs he had then: But beloved, doth <hi>Paul</hi> put out his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to plead for him? Doth he expect his comfort, or the Anſwer of Heaven for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge upon the plea of that righteouſneſſe of his? Nothing laſt; for, ſaith the Apoſtle there <hi>I account all things but loſſe and dung, that I may be found in him; not having mine own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is of the Law, but the righteouſneſſe of God, which is by faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Surely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, if the Apoſtle had reckoned that his righteouſneſs could have had any force in plea, he would never have rejected it as dung: That man that thinketh he hath ſtrength in an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will not fling that argument away, and not make mention of it for the triall of his cauſe, if he thought there were any power in it. But this the Apoſtle did, hee accounted his righteouſneſſe dung, even the righteouſneſſe of his, after he was converted; and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, he durſt not be found in that, but only
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:175622:123"/>in the righteouſnes of God, which is by faith in Chriſt. He doth not ſimply ſay, he would not be found in the righteouſneſs of the Law, but excluſively alſo; he would not be found in his own righteouſneſſe; ſo that he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Let me give one touch by way of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; you may eaſily perceive, how mightily people are miſtaken, and therefore no marvell they do live ſo uncomfortably; no marvell they are in fear of death, and thereby in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage all their life long, while they run for the refreſhment of their ſpirits to their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, to the plea of their own works; and will have their hearts eaſed upon that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe that they themſelves do, whereas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing gets a gracious diſcharge from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but only Chriſt, and his righteouſneſſe. Therefore, beloved, how ever it may go with ſome for a harſh thing, to take men off from their own righteouſneſſe, in reſpect of ſpeaking comfort unto them, and to lead them to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt revealed in the Goſpel, as that from which they may draw all their comfort, though this may found harſh to ſome
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:175622:124"/>people, that have not been trained up in the way of the grace of God, and in the freeneſſe, of it revealed in the Goſpel; yet I doubt not but in time, the Lord will be pleaſed to reveale to us, that running to Chriſt out of our ſelves, and diſclaiming of our owne righteouſneſſe, and ſeeking of comfort from it; that leaving our own actions, and all that can be imagined to be in us, or can be done by us, will be the thing that in the end will eſtabliſh our hearts and ſpirits, yea, and fill them with joy and peace in believeing.</p>

I ſhall give two or three paſſages by way of hint: It is true, the Apoſtle in the 10. to the <hi>Romans</hi> tells us, <hi>The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith ſpeaks on this wiſe;</hi> importing a righteouſneſſe of faith, which indeed before was called the righteouſneſſe of God himſelf, they ſubmitted not themſelves to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God; but, beloved, I take it the righteouſneſſe here, is called the righteouſneſſe of faith, as faith is the hand that doth cloſe with the righteouſneſſe of God; not as if this righteouſneſſe were properly faith, but meerly objective, as we ſay, Faith, as it lays hold upon that righteouſneſſe which is onely Chriſt the object thereof, in 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> verſe 16. the Apoſtle ſaith there, <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt; for it is the power of God to ſalvation, to every one that believeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:175622:125"/>
               <p>Mark it well, here is the power of God to ſalvation revealed. In what is the power of God to ſalvation? It is in it, ſaith the Apoſtle, that is, in the Goſpel, of which hee was not aſhamed; ſo it is the power of God to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to every one that believeth, but the power of God to ſalvation is not in believing, but, in it, that is, in the Goſpel. And what is the Goſpel of Chriſt there? Certainly, the Goſpel of Chriſt there, is not faith, but the object of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> For it is ſaid to be revealed from faith to faith. But, if you looke into the 2. or <hi>Luke,</hi> and the 10. verſe, there you ſhall ſee plainly, what the Goſpel of Chriſt is: An Angel came from Heaven to the Shepherds, and ſpeaks thus: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I bring you glad tidings,</hi> that is, I Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ring you glad ridings <hi>of exceeding great joy; for unto you is born this any in the City of David, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> The word Goſpel in the <hi>Romans,</hi> is the very ſame word drawn from the ſame theame with that in the 2. of <hi>Luke,</hi> verſe 10. It is as much as to ſay, the Goſpel is glad ridings of great joy, and what are theſe glad tidings? <hi>A Saviour is born unto you.</hi> So Chriſt a Saviour born to men, is the Goſpel; and ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I am not aſhamed of it,</hi> that is, I am not aſhamed of Chriſt borne a Saviour, for this reaſon; Chriſt is the power
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:175622:125"/>of God to ſalvation, to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth. In the 1. of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the 1. Chapter, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Wee are kept by the power of God through faith, unto ſalvation;</hi> where it is plainly imported, that faith unto ſalvation is the thorrow fare, it is but a meer chanell, through which the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt doth run, not communicating any righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelf, by which a perſon may ſtand righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God, or have diſcharge by the Lord, or from the Lord. This I would fain know, beloved, in every act, or in any act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, is the act of believing abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and compleat in all things, without any defect at all, or weakneſſe? Or, Is there ſome imperfection? There is ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection you muſt ſay. If then there be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, this I would fain known, how that thing that hath imperfection, that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe in it ſelf, can conſtitute a perſon by it ſelf righteous; Can <hi>Faith</hi> chargeable with unrighteouſneſſe, make a perſon unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in himſelf, ſtand righteous before God? The Apoſtle in the 7. to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> telling us of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>It behoveth us to have ſuch an high Prieſt, harmleſſe, holy, undefiled, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from ſinners;</hi> if Chriſt himſelf had had fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe with his righteouſneſſe, that very righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt it ſelf would not have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

               <p>Firſt, it is the cauſe of Believers, and the cauſe of Believers when they ſin; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cauſe of preſent Believers, but of the Elect, although not yet Believers, which yet in time ſhall be ſuch.</p>
               <p>We came alſo to conſider, how Chriſt this Advocate is qualified unto this office of Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateſhip.</p>
               <p>The qualifications of Chriſt are intimated in the three titles here attributed unto him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> that imports,
<list>
                     <item>1. A lawfull call to plead.</item>
                     <item>2. A ſufficient furniſhing him with skill to plead.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, he is <hi>Jeſus</hi> importing the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe of his plea: He pleads ſo well, that he ſaves his people from their ſins, he carries the cauſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſts qualification to his office of Advocateſhip, is imported in that attribute of <hi>Righteouſneſſe: Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:175622:127"/>that contains in it, the ſtrengh of his plea whereby he doth attain to the ſalvation of thoſe perſons whoſe cauſe be doth plead. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this laſt attribute we have obſerved, that the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt contains in it the ſtrength o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Chriſts plea, as Advocate whereby he doth become the propitiation for the ſins of his clients; I ſay, the ſtrength of his plea lies in this, that he is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous;</hi> we have therefore propoſed to be conſidered,</p>
               <p>Firſt, how cleer the Scripture is in this truth, that it is his righteouſneſſe that carries the cauſe of a poor Believer when he hath ſinned, and gets the diſcharge for his ſin, after it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; I ſay, the plea lies in his righteouſneſs. I cannot inſiſt upon the Scriptures mentioned, they are very plentifull.</p>
               <p>We came further, to conſider what this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of his is, that hath ſuch a ſtrength of plea in it; the reſolution of this I diſtributed into two heads:
<list>
                     <item>Firſt, Negative,</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Affirmative.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the righteouſneſſe which carries away the cauſe, and obtains the diſcharge of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſin, is no righteouſneſſe of our own, no, not ſo much as the righteouſneſſe of faith, as it is our act of believing. Here we left the laſt day.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:175622:128"/>I will give you a touch of the impoſſibility that faith ſhould ſo plead for the diſcharge from ſin in its own name or ſtrength, as to carry away the cauſe on the ſide of this perſon ſinning. It is true, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the righteouſneſſe of faith in the 10. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> about the 4. verſe. A righteouſneſſe of faith there is indeed, but that righteouſneſſe which is here given and aſcribed unto faith, is afterwards appropriated to the Word, that is, unto the Goſpel, that is the righteouſneſſe of faith ſpeaks on this wiſe; ſay not in thine heart, <hi>who ſhall aſcend up into Heaven? that is to bring Chriſt from thence; or, who ſhall deſcend into the deep?</hi> But what ſaith it? <hi>The Word is nigh thee in thy heart, &amp; in thy mouth.</hi> That is, in the word, in the heart, and in the mouth, that is, the word of Faith, and ſo not, the righteouſneſſe of a mans own act of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving I cannot dwell upon what I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered before.</p>
               <p>There are ſome things briefly to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, even about our believing, as it hath a ſtroke in the diſcharge from ſin, or in the pardon of ſin. The truth is, beloved, ſome hand faith hath in this buſineſſe; but it is not any righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in the act of believing that carries any ſtroke in it. If you will conſider it well, you ſhall eaſily ſee, there is no more righteouſneſſe in our believing, as we do act believing, then
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:175622:128"/>there is in any other gracious act whatſoever we do; there is no more righteouſneſſe in the act of our beleving, then is in our love of God: nay more, there is as much ſinfulneſſe in our act of believing, as in our acting of other gifts. There is no man under Heaven hath attained unto that height of believing, or that ſtrength of faith, but there is ſtill ſomething wanting, ſome imperfection and ſinfulneſſe in it: And as there is weakneſſe and imperfection in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; ſo it is not poſſible that this believing ſhould give forth ſuch a righteouſneſſe, as to conſtitute a perſon who is unrighteous in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to be righteous before God. That which cannot ſet it ſelf compleat and righteous before God, can never ſet another righteous before God, Faith muſt be firſt juſt it ſelf, or elſe it is not poſſible it ſhould be imagined it can ever by the righteouſneſſe of its own act juſtifie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Beloved, what ever the Scriptures ſpeak concerning faith juſtifying, it muſt of neceſſity be underſtood objectively, or declaratively, one of theſe two wayes: Either faith is ſaid to be our righteouſneſſe, in reſpect of Chriſt onely, who is believed on, and ſo it is not the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of his own act of believing, but the righteouſneſſe of him that is apprehended by that act of believing: Or, elſe you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it declaratively, that is, whereas all our
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:175622:129"/>righteouſneſſe, and all our diſcharge from ſin, flowing only from the righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone, is an hidden thing; that which in it ſelf is hid to men, doth become evident by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. And as faith doth make the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt evident to the Believer; ſo it is ſaid to juſtifie by its own act declaratively, and no otherwiſe. And whereas in the 5. Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the 1. verſe, the Apoſtle there ſaith, <hi>being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God.</hi> In <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. verſ. 33. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is God that juſtifieth.</hi> Now, I beſeech you compare theſe Texts together, then tell mee whether the act of believing, except it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the object, which is Chriſt, of it ſelf doth juſtifie. whether or no theſe two places ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibly be reconciled without contradiction. It is God that juſtifieth, and it is Faith that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth; Faith is not God, neither is God Faith. If therefore it be faith in juſtification, in reſpect of its own act that juſtifieth, it is not God that juſtifieth us; and if it be God that juſtifieth, then it is not Faith in reſpect of its own act. How will you reconcile it? When therefore the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of faith juſtifying, it ſpeaks of faith as laying hold upon God for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and therefore though faith doth here appeare as that which doth lay hold upon the righteouſneſſe of God, yet faith here cannot be
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:175622:129"/>ſaid to be that righteouſneſſe that doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But I know ſome will be ready to ſay, it is not to be underſtood, as if ſaith had any innate power of its owne to procure the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge or pardon from ſin; but ſaith is to bee underſtood as the Inſtrumentall cauſe, that laies hold upon that juſtification, and ſo it goes before the juſtification of a perſon, and it is to be underſtood no otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall deſire to keep in the plain path for the cleering up of this truth, and ſo far as poſſible may be, I abhor to walk in the clouds, in a truth that ſo highly concerns the comfort and eſtabliſhing the conſciences and ſpirits of men; and therefore, I ſay, that faith, as it layes hold upon the righteouſneſſ of Chriſt, it doth not bring this righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to the ſoul, but only doth declare the preſence of this righteouſneſſe in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that was there, even before faith was. I beſeech you mark me wel, I know, beloved, I have many very catching ears about me; I ſpeak it the rather, that there may be the more warines, becauſe there are frequent miſ-underſtandings &amp; miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:175622:130"/>juſtified and reconciled unto God before hee doth believe. And therefore faith is not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument radically to unite Chriſt and the ſoul together: but rather is the fruit that follows &amp; flows from Chriſt the root, being united before hand to the perſons that doe believe; ſo that the efficacy and power of believing, is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall for the declaration of an act that was done before, only it was hid. For the cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of this to you, beloved, conſider that expreſſion in the 12. Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> verſ. 1. <hi>Faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeene.</hi> Faith is the evidence, ſaith the Text, of things not ſeen. The Apoſtle here doth not give any efficacy to faith to procure or bring forth a new thing, but he gives to faith only an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing power, and that not to evidence any new thing, but to be an evidence of things not ſeen, that is, of things that were before in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but were hid: but by faith come to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and ceaſe to be hid, and are manifeſt and open when the evidence of faith doth bring them forth to light: Either you muſt ſay it is not in being till faith is come, and ſo faith doth more then evidence, even beget, and give being to the very thing, or you muſt confeſſe the thing indeed was: but faith makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that before was hid and obſcure. Now,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:175622:130"/>though faith be honoured with the greateſt buſineſſe of all the gifts of the Spirit of God, yet that Chriſt may not be robbed of that which is peculiar unto him, and properly his own, that is, to give compleat being to our juſtification, that it ſhould be given unto faith it ſelf: I ſay, give me leave to propoſe to you ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, wherein it is as cleer as the day-light, that it is impoſſible for any perſon under Heaven to believe, till ſuch time as this perſon be firſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Chriſt, and become one with him, and that faith it ſelf being but a fruit that flows from our union with him, is not the uniter that knits Chriſt and a perſon together, I ſhall not need to inſiſt upon that place I have often made mention of in the 16. of <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> But, beloved, when you take this point into conſideration, I beſeech you remember that paſſage in the 8. and 9. verſes. The time when God faſtened his love upon the Church, was the <hi>time of the blood of the Church; When I ſaw thee polluted in thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:175622:131"/>waſhed I thee with water; yea, I throughly waſhed thee from thy blood.</hi> Here is firſt loving and ſpreading the sk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If any man do think that this waſhing is to be underſtood of ſanctification, let them but conſider, whether or no there be a through-waſhing from bloud, a perfect waſhing from bloud, ſuch a waſhing from bloud, as that the perſon ſo waſhed, is preſently all fair; or, as the Prophet ſpeaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in that Chapter, <hi>compleat in beauty,</hi> that is, perfect, and that through his comelineſs put upon this perſon.</p>
               <p>But to go on, conſider, I beſeech you, beloved, that expreſſion in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.22, 23. the Lord there is pleaſed, firſt, to deciare himſelf concerning his people, in what a condition they were, their condition was this: <hi>Thou haſt not called upon me, but thou haſt been weary of me: yea, thou haſt wearied me with thy ſins, and thou haſt made mee to ſerve with thy tranſgeeſſions,</hi> ſaith the Lord. And mark what follows; <hi>I, even I am hee that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine owne ſake, and will not remember thy ſins;</hi> Here the people whoſe ſins God blotted out, are not conſidered

               <p>And in the 53. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> whereof I ſpake ſo largely heretofore, if you marke well, in the 6. verſe, you ſhall ſee plainly, there is nothing but ſin conſidered in the perſon, whoſe iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles the Lord laid upon Chriſt: <hi>All wee, like ſheep, have gone aſtray, we have turned every one of us to our own way, and hee hath laid on him the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity of us all.</hi> Here is not a conſideration of people as believing people, as though there muſt be a believing, before there can be a diſcharge from ſin; but there is a conſideration of people before they are believing people, even while they are a people going aſtray, and turning eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to their owne way. But the moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expreſſion of all to this purpoſe, is in the 15. of <hi>John.</hi> I deſire you that you would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider the ſtrength of Chriſts plea in that place, about the 4. &amp; 5. ver. you ſee Chriſt comparing himſelf, in the beginning of the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:175622:132"/>Chapter, ſaith, <hi>I am the Vine, and my Father is the Husbandman; every branch in me that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth fruit, my Father purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit: every branch in me that beareth not fruit, is caſt forth as a branch, and withereth.</hi> But the main thing that I defire to be obſerved, is this: <hi>Abide in me, as the branch abideth in the Vine; for, as the branch that abideth not in the Vine, cannot bring forth fruit, no more can yee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee abide in me.</hi> Out of which paſſage of Scripture, I ſhall deſire you to obſerve briefly theſe particulars,; wherein, I hope, it will be cleer and plain unto you, that it is impoſſible a perſon ſhould believe, till Chriſt hath united himſelf to this perſon. I know, beloved, there is none, or at leaſt I cannot meet with any yet, that will deny, but that faith or believing is a fruit of the branch that groweth upon the Vine, that is, one of the fruits of the Spirit, that are wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt in thoſe that are Chriſts: For in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> towards the end of the Chapter, you ſhall finde the Apoſtle reckon up the fruits of the Spirit, and he takes up faith for one of thoſe fruits amongſt the reſt. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believing be a fruit that perſons beare by vertue of union to the Vine Chriſt, then it muſt needs follow, men muſt firſt be in Chriſt, then believe; For, if perſons do believe before
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:175622:132"/>they are vnited, and their union by by a faith that they do act, then ſurely the branch muſt beare this fruit, before it be in the Vine, before there be union. And, if faith be the uniter, it is preſent before the union be made, and ſo the branch doth bear fruit before it doth abide in the Vine, contrary to Chriſts words: For it is maintained and affirmed, that it is faith that doth make the union, and therefore cannot be a fruit of that union. Beloved, this I would fain know of any perſon, Is faith the gift of Chriſt, or no? Is it Chriſt that workes faith in thoſe that do believe in Chriſt, or no? The Apoſtle in the 12. Chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and the 2. verſe, ſaith expreſly, that Chriſt is the <hi>Author of our faith.</hi> Is Chriſt then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our faith, and yet is that faith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our union unto Chriſt? Can a father beget a childe, and yet this childe beget his own father? Doth Chriſt beget faith in us by vertue of our being united unto him? and ſhall this faith beget that union of which it was but a fruit? From whence ſhall perſons that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve before they are united unto Chriſt, receive this faith of theirs? They are not yet united unto Chriſt, and therefore it cannot come from him, for we can have nothing of Chriſt but by vertue of union, and then it proceeds not from the Spirit of Chriſt neither, for we partake of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:175622:133"/>that only by vertue of union with him too From whence ſhould it come then? If you have it not from him by vertue of union, it is not from the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne that his perſon is incorporated into already, becauſe there muſt be union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be communion: All communion with Chriſt, all participating of any thing of Chriſt, proceeds from the union perſons firſt have with him; he is the root, &amp; as the branch is incorporated into the body and root, ſo ſap and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fluence it communicated and floweth out into the branch from the root. But this, you will ſays is but a parabolicall expreſſion, and Parables preve nothing.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, whereas Chriſt is pleaſed to apply the Parabie, his application of the Parable hath as full a proofe in it ſelfe, as any Scripture whatſoever. Now, in this place you ſhall finde, that Chriſt doth make exact application of it himſelfe to the purpoſe we now ſpeake of, as wee ſinde in theſe words: <hi>As the branch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring forth fruit, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye, exceptye abide in me: I am the Vine, ye are the branches, &amp;c.</hi> Ye cannot bring forth fruit, except ye abide in the Vine; and doe you abide in the Vine, when you are not unitted unto Chriſt? No man can ſay it. Can you bring forth fruit before you are in the Vine? Can you believe before you are in Chriſt?
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:175622:133"/>Beloved, it is as great an abſurdity to ſay you can, as to ſay a branch can bring forth fruit without a roote. So that, beloved, you muſt hold this for an undenyable truth, you cannot bring forth fruit, except you abide in the Vine. I can bring many other paſſages for the further proof of this thing, but this will ſuffice. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me not, I do not any way aim at any dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to believing, but my deſire is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving might have its proper office, and may not encroach upon the office of Chriſt himſelf. It is the Lord himſelf, of his own meer Grace, without reſpect to any thing in the world, in men, that makes him give his Son Chriſt unto perſons, that hee might be the juſtification of them. In the 42. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the 6. verſe, you ſhall ſee there expreſly, Chriſt is given of the Father, and hee is given as a covenant by the Father, before ever men have eyes to ſee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever they have faith to behold Chriſt: <hi>I will give thee for a covenant to the people to open the blind eyes.</hi> He himſelf as the Covenant, and as given, muſt open the blind eyes, or elſe they ſhall never be operted. Wee muſt not have our eyes opened, and than have Chriſt given to us, but Chriſt is firſt given, and then our eyes are opened: We muſt not believe, that ſo we may be in convenant with Chriſt: but wee muſt firſt be in covenant with him, and then believing
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:175622:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>that muſt follow as the fruite of the covenant. If wee have faith before wee bee united unto Chriſt, if our eyes be opened before Chriſt be given to be the covenant, then Chriſt is antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated and prevented: For, whereas he comes of purpoſe to open the blind eyes, and is given for this very thing, to open the blind eyes, the eyes are opened already, and this work is done before he comes; and ſo his coming, and the end thereof, is made fruſtrate, &amp; in vain in that reſpect. In briefe, ſuppoſe that our faith doth act towards the diſcharge of our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then it muſt follow, it is not only the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt that pleads by way of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocateſhip with the Father for this diſcharge. If thou come to the Lord, &amp; plead out that for thy ſelf by vertue of thy faith, which his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe alone was appointed for to do, and doſt not wholly caſt thy ſelf upon that, as that which will bear thee out in all thy approaches to God; but joyn thy faith withall in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I have ſpoken, and ſay in thy heart, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and in that plead thy diſcharge; if you put this into your plea for the diſcharge of ſin, Chriſt only is not your ſole Advocate, but your faith alſo doth concur with Chriſt in this office of Advocateſhip, and ſo you make it your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, then which, what can be more diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and more derogatory unto this glorious
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:175622:134"/>office of his? For if wee muſt believe before God will juſtifie us, then the ſimple and only plea of Chriſts righteouſneſs alone is not all-ſufficient for God to pardon or to diſcharge ſin: For, ſuppoſe I have not yet believed, now the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, it ſeems, hath not ſtrength enough, till my believeing come in, and joyn with that righteouſneſs: But it is only the righteouſneſs of Chriſt that pleads out the juſtification of a perſon, and not the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our believing that pleads it out; our believing, I confeſſe, gives comfortable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that God hath freely juſtified perſons, in and through the alone righteouſneſs of his Son Chriſt, our believing doth conduce to the declaration and manifeſtation of that which God for Chriſts righteouſneſs ſake did doe. By faith wee have evidence of this thing, but it is not our believing that works the thing it ſelf. Now, it remains we goe on, and conſider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affirmatively, what this righteouſnes of his is, that carries the whole ſtrength of the plea, for the diſcharge of the people of God from their ſins which they have committed; I ſay, it is his righteouſneſs, and his alone. Now, this righteouſneſs is to be conſidered in the quality, quantity, and nature of it: concerning the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and quantity of it in brief; that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that hath the ſtrength of plea for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

That he charges her with, is poverty, and wretchedneſſe, blindneſſe and nakedneſſe; the courſe hee puts her upon, is to receive of him gold and white raiment: it is white, there is the excellent purity of it; and this rayment is ſo large and ſpacious, that if ſhe ſhould be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered therewith, not a jot of the ſhame of her nakedneſſe ſhall appear.

               <p>For anſwer to this, you know there are two diſtinct natures in Chriſt; hee is perfect God, and compleate man, and anſwerably there are two diſtinct righteouſneſſes in Chriſt: there is the eſſentiall righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:175622:137"/>righteouſneſs of his God-head; and there is alſo the qualitative righteouſneſs of the humanity. Now, although it be true, that in reſpect of the ineffectable union of theſe two natures, both theſe righteouſneſſes arein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable to the perſon of Chriſt; yet it is as true, there is no more confounding of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes of theſe two natures, then there is of the natures in the perſon; but we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as diſtinctly the one as the other. Now, the queſtion lieth mainly in this, whether of the righteouſneſſes it is, which pleads the diſcharge of a ſinner, whether the righteouſneſs of God, ſimply as God, or the righteouſneſs of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature. I anſwer, it is the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; God ſimply conſidered is not Chriſt, nor the human nature ſimply conſidered is not Chriſt neither: But it is Chriſt God and man, ineffably knit &amp; united in one, that makes up Chriſt. Accordingly I ſay, as Chriſt doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſt of God and man joyntly; ſo the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that becomes the righteouſneſſs of Chriſts people, is the righteouſneſs of both united, and not the righteouſneſs of each ſeverally. The ſimple righteouſneſſe of the humanity of Chriſt alone, is too ſhort, is too narrow to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the filth of all the ſins of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt: the ſimple eſſentiall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the God-head alone is not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable

If you ſpeak of reconciliation, which conſiſts of Gods exceptance of perſons, and his agreeing with perſons in the death of all controverſie between God and a perſon; for that is reconciliation, when perſons that were at varia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, are now made friends, &amp; all things that were objected between them areanfwered, and no more for one to ſay againſt another; I ſay, if you ſpeak of this reconciliation to God, it is appropriated to the blood of Chriſt: <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them:</hi> But how, will you ſay, and by what means comes in this reconciliation? In the 5.

In the 10. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and verſe 3. when the Apoſtle taxeth the <hi>Jews</hi> for going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe, that which hee taxeth them withall, is, that <hi>they did not ſubmit themſelves to the righteouſneſſe of God: Now the righteouſneſſe of God is manifeſted,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle; and in the 5. Chapter of the 2. Epiſtle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> and the laſt verſe; <hi>He was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi> I ſay, therefore, beloved, that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by which we attain to our diſcharge from ſin, and the pleading out of that diſcharge is the righteouſneſſe of God. The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that doth give the full diſcharge to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from ſin, muſt have ſomething that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God himſelf, conferred or added to the humane righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, as giving dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to it; I ſay, ſomething that is proper to God himſelf, muſt concur with the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt to make up a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat righteouſneſs for the diſcharge of a ſinner
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:175622:140"/>It is a known rule, nothing can give more to another, then it hath it ſelf; the very active and paſſive humane obedience of Chriſt can give no more to man then that active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience hath in it ſelf. Now, man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a ſinner, hath need of more then barely the humane active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt to make him righteous; the ſin that man doth commit, hath its extent according to the dignity of the perſon againſt whom the ſin is committed. You know, beloved, that crimes againſt Magiſtrates, have a deeper tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in them then any ordinary crime: The ſelf-ſame offence committed againſt a Prince, that is committed againſt an inferiour perſon, hath its additions of extent and hainouſneſſe according to the perſon of the Prince offended. Now, ſin is committed againſt an infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, againſt an Infinite God, and ſo hath a more deepneſſe of tincture and filthineſſe in proportion to the injury done to ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; in that reſpect ſin indeed becomes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite crime: For, ſtill according to the injury done, in reſpect of the perſon injured, ſo is the offence; you know the difference in ſlanders: ſlander a poore man, and it may be the action will not heare above ten pounds for it; but ſlander a rich merchant, whoſe credit goes far, there men lay an action of a thouſand pounds
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:175622:140"/>for the ſlander of ſuch a man in regard of his degree, the richman being greater then others, and his credit being of greater value, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in taking away his credit is ſo much the more hainous and higher.

Beloved, let it not ſeem ſtrange, that the very Godhead it ſelf muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſomething of its own to the active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to make it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat righteouſneſs. The divine nature doth give value and vertue to the obedience and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the human nature. The divine nature addeth ſo much, as to raiſe up that created obedience to an infinite value and height of worth. All that I contend for at this time, is but this very thing; namely, that the divine
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:175622:141"/>nature muſt give worth, and that ſimply the active and paſſive obedience of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt is not ſufficient of it ſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſomething of Gods own be communicated unto it to diſcharge a Believer from an infinite fault or guilt.</p>
               <p>But what it is that God doth communicate (more then this, that he gives value to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane righteouſneſſe) and how he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it, is a ſecret we know not. But this we are ſure of, we are made the righteouſneſſe of God in Chriſt, and that righteouſneſſe of God is the righteouſneſſe by which we come to have our diſcharge from ſin. The Apoſtle tells us in the 2. Chap. of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Colloſ. In him,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>dwel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Surely it doth import that Chriſt doth communicate ſomething that is Gods own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; and yet this will not import any eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:175622:141"/>thing that is wrought in our perſons, as if Chriſt did ſubſtantially change our natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods nature, or Gods into ours, which were a groſſe abſurdity. But this there is, there is a communication of an infinite value and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt: For the righteouſneſſe that becomes ours by which we ſtand compleat with God, it muſt have ſo much value, as I ſaid, as may ſtand in proportion to the breach of the Law of God. Now, if there be but a righteouſneſſe of Chriſts humane nature conſiſting in his active conformity to the Law, and ſuffering for the breach of the Law, and we to ſtand in this righteouſneſs, this righteouſneſſe will not make us compleat: For, mark, he that is compleat, by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt ſerve for every purpoſe whatſoever; if there ſhould be ſome defect, which the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, as it is acted by him in his human nature doth not make up, in reſpect of ſuch defect, we could not be compleat by it, although, that even as it is humane, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely compleat in his kinde, and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

                  </gap>l in the duties of their relation, they muſt go to Chriſt for a righteouſneſſe to ſupply this and all other defects. Now, where will you finde it in Chriſt? He never was a Father, nor a mother; Chriſt did never perform theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall offices requiſite to the ſeverall relations; Chriſt never brought up children; Chriſt was never a Magiſtrate. When a father failes in the duties of his re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ation, where can he finde out a righteouſneſſe fit for him to make it up in Chriſt? Now therefore the divine nature ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt adde ſome eminency of worth that muſt ſerve in the ſtead thereof, unto that the humane righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which his active and paſſive obedience, as humane did not
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:175622:142"/>particularly effect, or elſe there cannot be a compleat righteouſneſſe given by Chriſt unto this perſon; and therefore, whereas it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt the active obedience of Chriſt; for as much as it doth not ſerve for us inregard it is not every way anſwerable unto the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe done by man, therefore there muſt come a righteouſneſſe of faith in ſtead of that righteouſneſſe. I ſay, the remedy is worſe then the diſeaſe, and my ground is this; I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Chriſts active obedience through non-performance of ſome particulars required of us, be not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat righteouſneſſe for every circumſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, much leſſe faith, wherein as acted by us, there is both omiſſion of good, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of evil, which ſimply is ſin, whereas the active obedience of Chriſt could not be charged with the leaſt ſin in any kinde; I ſay, much leſſe can faith fill up this emptineſs, being it ſelf ſinfull, ſeeing the active obedience of Chriſt, being free from the leaſt ſpot of ſin, only through not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of theſe ſeverall duties of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall relations; and being but a created righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, could not fill it up; and therefore I collect from hence rather, that a ſupply here is from the dignity of the God head, which could not be in the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt, and this ſhall be in the ſtead of every particular circumſtance which ought to have
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:175622:143"/>been in the perfect accompliſhment thereof. So that though we faile in our relations, as of fathers and mothers and Magiſtrates. And the active obedience of Chriſt hath not theſe particulars in it; yet this is ſupplyed by the eminency of worth of the perſon being God himſelf, and it cannot poſſibly be any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſupplyed, but by the giving ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite value and vertue to that which Chriſt did, that though Chriſt did not every particular circumſtance which is wanting in us, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it doth amount in value to all particulars which we ſhould have done.</p>
               <p>Now, it remaineth that we ſhould onely conſider wherein the ſtrength of the plea of that righteouſneſſe doth conſiſt; we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what that righteouſneſs is; namely, the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt, made of infinite value, by a ſupply of worth from the dignity of the perſon ſuper-added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; we ſhould now, I ſay, have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wherein the ſtrength of the plea of that righteouſneſs doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>There are but two wayes by which perſons may be acquitted in judgement, being charged with any crime: Either by pleading and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not guilty, or by pleading and proving ful ſatisfaction made, though there be guilt; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe two wayes are enough to plead out a full diſcharge.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:175622:143"/>
               <p>As for the firſt way of plea, Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages it not, that is, Chriſt doth not plead <hi>non factum,</hi> Chriſt doth acknowledge this and that perſon did commit ſuch and ſuch tranſgreſſion. It is true, this he doth not deny; but the ſtrength of the plea of Chriſt doth conſiſt in the latter, that though the fact be done, yet Chriſt by vertue of this righteouſneſſe pleads out a ſatisfaction, and by vertue of that ſatisfaction, hee pleads out a ful diſcharge for thoſe that are his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</p>

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:175622:146"/>the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Obſerve it well, and in it you ſhall ſee the uſefulneſſe in ſeeking God in any way that the Lord will be ſought in.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Lord ſaith, <hi>Theſe things will I do;</hi> the Lord hath bound himſelf, he cannot alter it, the word is gone out of his mouth, the thing ſhall come to paſſe, when it is once gone out of his mouth, he will make that good for his own ſake, <hi>and I will be ſought unto by the houſe of Iſrael: I will doe it, you ſhall ſeeke mee; and when you ſeek me, I will make it good.</hi> So when we come to the Ordinances, wee look to what God hath promiſed, and upon what God hath ingaged himſelf to make good to us: And when we are upon the Ordinances, our eye is, or ought to be, upon the promiſes, not upon our performances, and the Ordinances, as if theſe our qualifications, and doing this or that were the procurers of that we deſire, but the procurer of that, is that which moved the Lord to make a promiſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as our righteouſneſſe hath not plea in it to prevaile of it ſelfe for diſcharge of ſin after commiſſion, ſo neither hath faith it ſelf any prevalency for the diſcharge of ſin. I ſay, the plea of ſaith it ſelf, hath no efficacy and ſtrength in it to get diſcharge from ſin. Faith improperly is called the righteouſneſſe of God. Look into the 10. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Apoſtle
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:175622:146"/>expreſſeth himſelft us: <hi>The righteouſnes of faith ſpeaks on this wiſe.</hi> &amp;c. Here by the <hi>righteouſnes of faith</hi> there cannot be meant the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the act of believing, but the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt believed on.</p>
               <p>I came to this aſſertion, that faith hath not ſuch prevalency of plea to diſcharge from ſin; I ſay not a prevalency of plea, as to obtain the diſcharge from ſin; Nay, ſaith hath not this prevalency, ſo much as to be an inſtrument to unite a ſoul unto Chriſt in its firſt union. I ſhall deſire, beloved, in this caſe, yet once more to be marked and heeded, both attentively and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, and ingenuouſly, and candidly. The aſſertion I delivered was this, and the reaſon why I deliver it again, I will tell you by and by. There is, I ſay, not ſuch a thing as an uniting and cementing, nor knitting power in faith, as that faith doth, or ſhould become the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to unite a ſoul in its firſt union unto Chriſt: For, before ſuch believing, a ſoul is united unto Chriſt, and a ſoul muſt be united unto Chriſt before it doth, or can believe: I ſaid this of elect perſons ſtill, and ſo carried it along to the end of the diſcourſe: That an elect perſon is united unto Chriſt before he can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Chriſt. Something I ſaid before for the cleering up of this truth, that a ſoul muſt be united unto Chriſt by Chriſts own power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:175622:147"/>can there be believing on him. But, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, whereas we had thought the truth had been cleered up ſufficiently, I have found it otherwiſe; I find that many ſtick and ſtumble at this aſſertion, there muſt be believing, fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> union with him.</p>
               <p>Since the laſt time I ſpake unto you, I have received, and I ſuppoſe, from an ingenuous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for under ſuch a ſtile it comes, an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt this aſſertion, and weighing the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I ſinde it of weight enough to require an anſwer. Beſides, I finde that divers other perſons, exceedingly ſtick and ſtumble at it; and therefore I ſhall deſire to cleer up this one thing, both by anſwering ſuch objections that may be made againſt it, as alſo by letting you ſee what dangers neceſſarily follow upon the contrary. I ſhall, and do commend the candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ingenuity of thoſe that ſeek to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in things they not yet ſo cleerly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, while they do it with a ſpirit, rather ſeeking ſatisfaction, then to maintain conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The objection propoſed is briefly this: Our Saviour very frequently in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holds forth believing, or faith, under the notion of coming unto him. The inference i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:175622:147"/>this, coming doth imply, or ſuppoſe a diſtance between the perſon and Chriſt, till there be coming. The effect ſeems to be, that he that comes to another is at diſtance from him till he be come. The upſhot or concluſion is this: If believing be a coming to Chriſt then thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that do thus come by believing, before their believing are at diſtance from Chriſt; and if at diſtance from Chriſt, then there can be no union between Chriſt and them till their coming drawes them, and makes them neerer, and ſo their coming doth unite them. The ground of this objection is taken out of ſome portions of Scripture, divers are objected for it, and one ſeems to have ſome ſtrength with it, and that is in <hi>Iohn,</hi> 5. chap. and the 40. verſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>You will not come to me that you might have life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Whence it is inferred, that there is no life till there be coming, and this coming is believing, and ſo conſequently there can be no union till there be this believing. The Argument indeed is laid as ſtrong as may be, and peradventure, may ſeem to have an undeniable ſtrength in it. Now, I ſhall deſire and endeavour to anſwer this objection as candidly as it was made, and it may be, other objections that may be made like unto this ſhall be anſwered in the anſwer of this.</p>
               <p>And, that you may better underſtand the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:175622:148"/>anſwer unto it, and the truth cleared, I ſhall anſwer two wayes, and it ſhall be,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the matter of the Argument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the proof of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in reſpect of the matter of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; The matter of it is this: before coming there muſt be a diſtance, and coming is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and therefore before believing, there muſt be neceſſarily a diſtance, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there muſt be no union.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For anſwer to this, beloved, we are to take into conſideration: Firſt, what is meant by diſtance, and then what by coming. If by diſtance in this place be meant diſ-union, as it ſeems it is, (becauſe the thing urged in the objection, is that there is not a union) then we ſhall proceed on accordingly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for this word coming; you know full well, that coming is but an Allegoricall expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and you muſt know, that all coming will not neceſſarily infer a diſtance before coming: Mark the expreſſion in the 7. chapter to the <hi>Hebrews, He is able to ſave to the utmoſt, all them that come to God by him;</hi> here is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of coming to God, and of Chriſt ability to ſave them that come. Now, conſider this with your ſelves: Suppoſe a Believer hath been a Believer many years together, and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as long united unto Chriſt, Whether or no
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:175622:148"/>doth not ſuch a Believer ſtill come to God by Jeſus Chriſt? Certainly, Believers, after they are Believers, do frequently come unto God. Now, doth coming import a diſtance before there be a coming? then there is a diſtance, even a diſ-union (for ſuch a diſtance we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of,) between Chriſt and Believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as oft as ever they do come. Obſerve that in the 17. chapter of <hi>Iohn,</hi> where Chriſt ſpeaks to the Father himſelf. <hi>And now, Father, I come to thee;</hi> Here Chriſt comes to the Father. I ask this queſtion, Was Chriſt at a diſtance, or was Chriſt diſ-united from the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did come to the Father? For he ſaith, <hi>now I come to thee;</hi> it ſeems, before this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſt was diſ-united, if the Argument be good, that where is coming, there is a diſtance, and this coming makes up union that was not before. It ſeems by this, there was no union, but a diſtance between Chriſt himſelf and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till now at this very time that he doth come: But Chriſt himſelf, in that very ſame place, teſtifieth the contrary, ſaying, <hi>Thou Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art in me, and I in thee.</hi> In a word, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it ſeems, muſt import believing: Suppoſe it be ſo, muſt there be diſtance, or diſ-union alwayes before ſuch a coming? then conſider this, that Believers, even to the end of their dayes, have occaſion ever and anon to renew
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:175622:149"/>their acts of believing, that is, to renew their act of coming to Chriſt: For, ſtill take this along with you, that coming and believing are all one, for ſo faith the Objector. Well, is coming and believing all one? then Believers have cauſe every day, and every hour, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a freſh, that is, to renew acts of believing and is there diſtance of diſ-union, before there be ſuch coming? then it muſt follow, there muſt be union and diſ-union, and union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and diſ-union again, and this as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent at there is the renewing of the acts of faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will ſay, peradventure the firſt act of coming to Chriſt, or the firſt act of believing, doth import diſ-union; but all after acts of believing do not import diſ-union.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer: Mark where the ſtrength of the Argument lyeth, and you ſhall plainly ſee, there is the very ſame reaſon for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter believing, as there is for the firſt act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: The firſt act of believing is coming, and is not two, three, or four acts of believing coming too? What coming is there more in one act of believing then in other acts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving? If this be a generall rule, that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is a coming, and coming argues a diſtance, and diſtance muſt neceſſarily be before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hence it muſt follow in brief, that it is no
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:175622:149"/>ſolid Argument, perſons are diſ-united, or not united unto Chriſt before the act of believing, becauſe believing is a coming unto him: For, you ſay and grant, that there may be, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is, a coming unto Chriſt by faith, and yet there may be union before ſuch coming.</p>
               <p>But now, to come to the proofes, to the texts of Scripture that are brought in for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it: <hi>You will not come to me, that you might have life.</hi> The ſtrength of the Argument it ſeems, lies in this; there is no life till there be coming, and coming is for life it ſelf; there fore there is no union, till there be coming by way of believing.</p>
               <p>For anſwer to this, and ſo to cleer up the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt: In this text of Scripture, we are, firſt, to conſider, what our Saviour means by coming in this place; <hi>You will not come to me:</hi> And ſecondly, we ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what this life is that Chriſt ſpeaks of which they ſhould have in coming to him.</p>
               <p>And to begin with the firſt, what that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is our Saviour ſpeaks of in in this place; <hi>You will not come to me, that you might have life.</hi> I will not inſiſt upon this, that Chriſt did ſpeak to the oppoſers, men that did conteſt with him, and ſo that he doth ſpeak to perſons with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and relation unto others: For, I verily believe, though our Saviour ſpeaks this to the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:175622:150"/>
                  <hi>Phariſces,</hi> who certainly never ſhould come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Chriſt, nor have life by Chriſt; yet his intent was to ſpeak to them to whom the life of Chriſt did belong, and who ſhould come to him. Let us therefore I ſay, conſider what he means by <hi>coming</hi> in this place. In <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. verſ. 44. there you ſhall have our ſaviour plainly expounding unto you, what he doth mean by coming unto him: <hi>No man,</hi> ſaith he there, <hi>cometh unto me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> Mark the expreſſion well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſhall perceive what Chriſt means by firſt coming unto him: For, in that place, <hi>You will not come to me that you might have life,</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks of firſt coming, and not of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter coming: <hi>No wan cometh unto me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> In which words you may perceive the act of firſt coming to Chriſt, is rather by, and from the Father, then by any activity in the perſon that comes: For, coming there, is plainly attributed unto a drawing act of the Father. So that the firſt coming to Chriſt, is juſt like the coming of a froward childe to meet the mother; the childe hath taken a ſtomach, and is ſullen and dogged, the childe will not ſtir; if the childe be carried, it ſtrives and ſtrugles, wherefore the Father of this childe is fain to take up this childe, and by a kinde of force to carry it with an overmaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:175622:150"/>ſtrength where meat is. The childe comes to his meat, but how? not by any act of the childe, as if he did come of himſelf, but by the power and over-maſtering of him that brings the childe: A coach we ſay comes to town; when it is but drawn to town, and yet it is ſaid to come. The Coach is wholly paſſive, the childe is paſſive in coming to meat; and ſo every elect perſon at his firſt coming to Chriſt; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this elect perſon to Chriſt is a paſſive coming: And the coming of this perſon is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Fathers over-maſtering and drawing of this perſon elected unto Chriſt. In the 31. of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> the Lord ſpeaking there of the converſion of <hi>Ephraim, Thou haſt chaſtiſed me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ephraim, &amp; I was chaſtiſed as a bullock unacquainted to the yoak; convert thou me, and I ſhall be converted. Ephraim</hi> here appropriates the act of his converſion, not to any coming of his own, but only to the Lord himſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, that the work of bringing unto Chriſt is the work of Gods own drawing; nay, he ſheweth, that he himſelf was ſo far from coming, that he did confeſſe, that when God took him firſt in hand, to bring him to Chriſt, he was as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoak. It is true, in a common ſpeech the bullock is ſaid to come unto the yoak, even a bullock un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed, but how? by meer force he is
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:175622:151"/>brought to it, and not that he is brought wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to it. Beloved, you muſt either eſtabliſh the rotten Principle of <hi>Free-will,</hi> that is, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious principle of a mans own ſpirit to come to Chriſt, or you muſt confeſſe that perſons at their firſt coming unto Chriſt, are meerly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. It is a known principle: we are firſt acted, or actuated, before we do, or can act; there is not only a weakneſſe ſimply before calling, but there is a deadneſſe, and therefore there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be coming; and if there be, it is meerly paſſive, and the whole buſineſſe muſt be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers own drawing. In the 110. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and about the 3. verſe, the Lord ſpeaks to Chriſt thus: <hi>Thy people ſhall be a willing people in the day of thy power.</hi> There is no willingneſſe till the over-ruling and overcoming power of Chriſt comes in to make and frame a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe even contrary to the naturall will.</p>
               <p>The ſumme then briefly is this, and ſo to apply it to the Text objected, <hi>You will not come to me, that you might have life,</hi> that is, it hath not pleaſed the Father to draw you unto me, that you might have life. I cannot conceive how there can be any other ſenſe given to the Text, but that it is the Fathers ſole and only power, and the overcoming act of his, to bring to Chriſt, that there may be life. Now, what will be the ſenſe of the words? it will be only

Now, while the Father is draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that very drawing is an argument of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a kinde of kicking againſt that which the Father doth aim at: For, if there were yeelding; if there were a ſubmitting; if there
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:175622:152"/>were a willing coming on to the truth reveald, what need there any drawing? men do not draw thoſe things that do come of themſelves, And therefore I ſay, during the Fathers firſt act of drawing, the Father laying violent hold, as it were, upon the perſon, there is no act of believing.

Now, the Philoſophers do obſerve of the naturall ſoul, that it is the framer of its own body, and the maker of its own organs, that ſo they may be fitted for it to act its own will: ſo may I ſay, is it with Chriſt, Chriſt hath the framing and the diſpoſing of the whole man, to bring every thing in this man to his own bent: The Father bringing the creature, as he is a ſtubborn and ſtiff-necked creature, ſo delivers him up to his Son; ſo that, I ſay, there is not a pevious foregoing act wrought by the Father without Chriſt; I ſay, no previous act of believing wrought by the Father, or by the Spirit, without Chriſt, by which a perſon comes, and doth cloſe with Chriſt, but the Father doth give that perſon without any faith at all, or any qualifications whatſoever, to his Son; and his Son, Chriſt himſelf, he frames and creates that very faith in perſons to come to him; and therefore in
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:175622:153"/>the 42. of <hi>Iſai.</hi> v. 6. you ſhall plainly ſee, there is not an opening of blind eyes, a giving of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eyes, to cloſe with Chriſt before Chriſt himſelf be given, and given as a covenant to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: So ſaith the Text, <hi>I will give thee for a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> Here you ſee Chriſt paſſed to perſons, not with a ſuppoſition, that when perſons do believe he ſhall be theirs, and they his, but, <hi>I will give thee for a covenant to open the blind eyes;</hi> Here is not the eyes opened before Chriſt comes, but Chriſt comes when the ey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> are blind, and when he comes, he opens the eyes that are blind.</p>
               <p>But to go further; Let us ſuppoſe, that coming into this place, is ſpoken of believing: <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life;</hi> it cannot follow, that although there be no life till believing, therefore there can be no union till believing: I ſay, if it poſſibly might be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that there may not be life from Chriſt, till believing, yet it follows not, that there muſt be believing before there is union. Nay, beloved, there is nothing cleerer in all the world then this principle; namely, Suppoſe there cannot be life before there be believing, yet there muſt be union before there can be life fetched from Chriſt; I ſay, there muſt be union before belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving can fetch life from Chriſt: For, ſuppoſe that the fruit upon a branch ſhould have ſuch a faculty to draw life into the branch from the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:175622:153"/>root; though this would be a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that the fruit growing upon a tree, ſhould have a faculty to draw life from the root to the branch, whereas the root com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates life to the branch, and the branch by vertue of that life communicated, brings forth fruit. But yet, ſuppoſe the fruit ſhould draw life into the branch from the root, that is, ſuppoſe that faith which is a fruit, growing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a member of Chriſt, that is a Believer, and a branch of that body; ſuppoſe that faith this fruit ſhould have ſuch a faculty to draw life from Chriſt the root into the branch, yet it is impoſſible that faith ſhould draw life into the branch, till the branch be united unto the ſtock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, beloved, that is Chriſts compariſon: <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the branches;</hi> Now, take this compariſon; ſuppoſe a branch growing upon a wilde Olive, is cut off from the wilde Olive, and for the preſent it is not united to the good Olive tree; Now, can a wilde Olive, or ſuppoſe it to be a good Olive upon this branch of the wilde tree, can this fruit upon the branch draw life from the root of the good Olive tree, while it is ſeparated and laid aſide, and is not united to the good Olive, from which root it muſt draw life? It is known to all men, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is the fruit of union; there is no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation nor communion of any thing that
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:175622:154"/>is Chriſts, but as it doth flow from union with Chriſt; ſo that either you muſt ſay, that faith which you ſpeak of, is not of Chriſt the root, but hath ſome other root and fountain from whence it hath its being and eſſence; or elſe you muſt confeſſe, if Chriſt be the root, then it muſt come from Chriſt by vertue of union of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to Chriſt firſt.</p>
               <p>Finally, ſuppoſe it ſhould be, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is believing; ſuppoſe that this life ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of here, is not in perſons till they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: What is meant by life here? Beloved, I beſeech you conſider, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>our life is hid with Chriſt in God; and Chriſt is the life of the world,</hi> that is, of the elect. It ſeems then that the life of every elect perſon hath a being in Chriſt, before he doth believe; belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore doth not produce a new life that was not before, only it manifeſts that life which was before; and it makes that life which was before, an active life; or is an inſtrument by which that life that is hid in Chriſt, doth now after believing, become an active and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life in this perſon. So that all that can be made of this, is but this; till believing, there is no activeneſſe of the life of Chriſt in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is elected, his life is in Chriſt, and was in Chriſt, and reſerved in Chriſt, till the time of believing for him; and then doth he
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:175622:154"/>the elect perſon, become active in life, when Chriſt doth give him to believe actually.</p>
               <p>But to ſay that this believing ſhould give the firſt being of that life that ſhould be in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is to ſay, there is not the life of the elect perſons in Chriſt before they do believe.</p>
               <p>In a word, beloved, I ſhall ſeriouſly deſire you, that with candidneſs and ingenuity of ſpirit, you would take into your conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thoſe dangerous conſequences that muſt of neceſſity follow, if you will receive this for a Principle, that there is no juſtification and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all belonging unto elect perſons, till they do actually believe in Chriſt,; I ſay, If this be maintained, dangerous conſequences muſt needs follow upon it; if perſons are not united unto Chriſt, and doe not partake of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before they doe believe, but that believing is the inſtrument by which they are firſt united, then mark what will follow upon it.</p>
               <p>Firſt this, that in ſome reſpect there will be a bringing to life again the covenant of works. How will that be, will you ſay? I beſeech you conſider it well; The Apoſtle will tell you ſo as well as I: The Lord told <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt, <hi>Doe this and live; If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandements,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to the rich man: And the Apoſtle in the 10. Chap. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> about the 4. and 5. verſes, tells us of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:175622:155"/>covenant of Works cleerly: <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaith he, deſcribing the righteouſneſſe of the Law, ſaith thus: <hi>He that doth theſe things, ſhall even live in them;</hi> mark here the covenant of Works, out of theſe expreſſions, is this; namely, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to do, that they may live: The covenant of Grace runs upon contrary terms; men muſt firſt live, that they may doe: God in his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, gives life firſt, and from life comes doing. In the covenant of Works, there muſt be firſt doing for life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, how doth this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low out of this conceit, that men muſt believe, before they ſhall live in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, thus; you muſt of neceſſity preſſe upon your ſelves theſe terms, or ſuch like, I muſt do, that I may have life in Chriſt, I muſt believe, there is no life till I do believe; now, if there muſt be living firſt, then there is doing before living.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be you will ſay, Faith is oppoſed to Works and doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, when it is oppoſed to Works, it be underſtood objectively, that is, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Chriſt believed on, and not of the act it ſelf of believing; for it is certain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, our act of believing, is as much our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as our acts of love, or our acts of charity, even as much our doing as any of theſe. So that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:175622:155"/>here muſt firſt be doing before life be obtained; if perſons muſt firſt believe before they have union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if there muſt be our act of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before there be participating in Chriſt, then mark what will follow; thoſe ſins which were once laid upon Chriſt, and taken away from the elect; for they could not be laid upon him, unleſſe they were taken from them, they are, it ſeems, returned back again, upon this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, whereas they were charged upon Chriſt, whereas Chriſt once paid the full price, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as upon the paiment of this price, there was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged full ſatisfaction; ſo that thoſe ſins were once blotted out; I ſay, if there muſt be believing before there be union with, or intereſt in Chriſt, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that till ſuch believing, the perſon of that elect, doth beare his own tranſgreſſion, and is chargeable for his owne tranſgreſſions, and his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are imputed unto him. But how can it ſtand with the glory of the Redemption of Chriſt, that Chriſt ſhould have all iniquity laid upon himſelf, carring all iniquity like the Scape Goat into the Land of forgetfulneſſe, and yet till the time of that elect, perſons believing theſe ſins are returned from the Land of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs whither they were once carryed, and they are afreſh charged upon this perſon
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:175622:156"/>agine. Did Chriſt bear them away? and did Chriſt return them back again? Where did you ever finde, that ſin once taken away, and carryed away by Chriſt from the perſon offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, did returne back again upon the perſon from whom Chriſt took it way?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe this, that men have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt till actually they do believe in him, then it muſt follow, that theſe perſons, till they are actually believers, are under the hatred of God: For, if they bear their own tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themſelves, then God being a jealous God, his holy and pure nature everlaſtingly hating iniquity, and alſo the perſon upon whom ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is charged; there muſt be a hatred of God upon theſe perſons till they do believe; and to conceive that God doth hate theſe perſons, is to conceive that God may love and hate the ſame perſon, whereas he ſaith, in the 19. Chap. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> concerning <hi>Jacob,</hi> that being yet unborn, <hi>Jacob have I loved;</hi> here you ſee love is communicated to <hi>Jacob,</hi> being yet unborn. Now mark, <hi>Jacob</hi> when he was not yet born, was not an actuall believer, till after times, <hi>Jacob</hi> was not come to believe. Well, had <hi>Jacob</hi> no intereſt in Chriſt and the love of God till ſuch time as he did believe? Yea, <hi>bee had</hi> ſo ſaith the Text. I, but yet <hi>Iacob</hi> muſt be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till he doth believe, becauſe <hi>Jacob,</hi> till he
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:175622:156"/>doth believe, muſt bear his own tranſgreſſions; ſo that here muſt be at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame time, upon the ſame perſon, both the love and hatred of God, and how can theſe contraries ſtand together?</p>
               <p>Yet again; Suppoſe perſons have no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt untill they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e actually believe, it muſt follow from thence neceſſarily, that there is a believing in ſuch perſons before they have union with Chriſt, and then you muſt make ſome other root from whence this believing of perſons muſt ſpring; as for Chriſt, it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with him, for he hath nothing in regard of communicating his Grace &amp; Spirit to do with them; but they are Beuevers, and their believing is that which knits the knot between Chriſt and them; Whence comes this believing? where is the root of it? Is Chriſt the root? then have they firſt union with Chriſt, that they may receive it from him; then muſt they firſt be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Chriſt, and made one with him, and live in him, and by vertue of union with him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this faith as a fruit of that union. If it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſome other root, I beſeech you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how it can be, and how can this be avoided, but that this conceit muſt needs be exceeding derogatory to Chriſt, to make another founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beſides Chriſt, whereas in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid there, <hi>Chriſt is the author as well as the finiſher of faith?</hi> Beloved, upon theſe confidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:175622:157"/>for my own part, I have receiv'd this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that I have delivered unto you, and meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the vindication of the glorious priviledges which are proper &amp; peculiar unto Chriſt alone, is the occaſion that I do refer the being of faith it ſelf unto Chriſt, and to nothing elſe in the world, and that I may uphold theſe particular and glorious prerogatives that are proper to Chriſt, that he may not be robbed of any of them. To this end, I deliver it to you, that elect perſons have a participation and ſhare in Chriſt himſelf, even before they do beleive, &amp; let none conceive that this takes away or diminiſheth from the prerogative of believing neither. For there are glorious things done by faith unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, God hath honoured it above all meer creaturs in the world; he hath made it the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit pipe for the conveyance of all that peace and comfort; nay, of al that ſtrength which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have all their lives; no faith, no comfort; no faith, no peace of conſcience; no faith, no pleſure to walk with God: through faith Chriſt conveys himſelf in ſpeaking peace to the foul, in bidding the ſoul be of good cheer; the ſoul lies in darknes, while it lies in unbelief. But ſtill that which is proper &amp; peculiar to Chriſt alone, is not to be aſcribed unto believing. I ſhould now proceed (having as well as I can, taken away the rubs) to that which I purpoſe to follow. But the time is paſt.</p>

In the large open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this righteouſneſs unto you, I ſpake firſt, negatively. The plea that prevails for the diſcharge of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in, is not our works; no, not our faith; but it is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt himſelf that onlyſerves to make up the ſtrength of this plea: Secondly, affirmatively; There is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, an active righteouſneſs of Chriſt; For, <hi>by the obedience of one man, many ſhall be made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5.19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the paſſive righteouſneſs of Chriſt: <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. But it is the divine righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or dignity of the divine God-head that adds an efficacy and life, and vertue, making the active and paſſive righteouſneſs of Chriſt a compleat righteouſneſſe, that wee might be compleat in him; and we gave a touch to you, wherein the efficacy of the plea of this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſtands. The efficacy of it ſtands in the ſatisfaction that righteouſneſs hath made to the juſtice of God. In judgment there are but two wayes to be acquitted, either juſt proof, that the perſon upon triall is not guilty, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:175622:158"/>guilty, the Law is already ſatisfied. The ſtrength of the plea of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, inſiſts not upon the firſt way, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> grants the perſons whoſe cauſe he pleads, had for matter of fact, done the thing that is charged; but the ſtrength of his plea is, that the Law on their behalf is ſatisfied already. This latter plea being good, hath the like force for acquittance and diſcharge as the former hath; So that the ſentence of judgement can no more paſſe upon the perſon for whom the Law is ſatisfied, then it can upon perſons that never tranſgreſſed the Law.</p>
               <p>Now it remains to be conſidered by way of objection out of the premiſes, how this can be, that the juſtice of God ſhould be ſatisfied, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſatisfaction of juſtice is the bringing of a recompence to anſwer in proportion for the offence that is committed. The ground of the objection is this, all that Chriſt, as man, brings unto God, comes ſhort to make a full recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. I told you before, that the divine righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is that that makes the righteouſneſſe compleat, and that a meer humane righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not able to effect, till it be infinite, or be made infinite by the divine righteouſneſſe. Now, when Chriſt brings a recompence to the Father for the tranſgreſſions of men, that that he brings to him by way of recompence, ſhould
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:175622:159"/>not be that which was his own before. Now, what ever the divine righteouſneſs is, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Gods own, the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſts human nature, that is brought to him, but the divine righteouſneſs is not brought. You will ſay, this is juſt as one man oweth another an hundred pounds, and he ſueth this man for it; now, the debtor, he cannot raiſe above ten pounds of this money: but the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor muſt make it up out of his own purſe. So then here is the ground of the objection, and the truth is, this matter contains in it, the depth of the myſterie of the Goſpel, that juſtice ſhould be ſatisfied by bringing a recompence for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and yet the recompence, as it is brought, is not ſo much as will anſwer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury that is done of it ſelf. It is true, there is enough in the divine Righteouſneſſe to make the ſatisfaction for the injury done; But how is this divine Righteouſneſſe brought?</p>
               <p>It is moſt certainly true, therefore, even where there is ſatisfaction of juſtice in this caſe, there is alſo mercy too: For, although God be juſt to forgive ſin, yet obſerve the phraſe well, you ſhall finde, that where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of juſtice in this act of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſinz, he ſpeaks of mercy too: You know, to forgive a thing is an act of grace and mercy; yet, even while there is forgivenes there
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:175622:159"/>is manifeſted the act of juſtice, Juſtice it ſelfe takes its courſe, even while there is forgivneſs. But this, you will ſay, doth not reſolve the queſtion: Where can there be a ſatisfaction of juſtice, ſeeing there is not brought by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, that which might be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the injury done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt of all, juſtice is ſatisfied in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, when there is ſuch a plenary and equivalent recompence given, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon injured thereby, is in as good eſtate every way, as he was before the injury done: When a man is treſpaſſed againſt, and doth ſue the man for this treſpaſſe, and when the man doth make up, and bring in as much recompence as the injury commeth to; ſo that the party treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed is worth as much as he was before, here is a plenary ſatisfaction of juſtice. Now comes in the objection, and ſayes, that the juſtice of God cannot be ſaid to be ſo ſatisfied, becauſe the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt, as humane, bring not in ſo much to God as the injury comes to, and what is from the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, is Gods own before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, therefore ſome ſay, that there is a ſatisfying juſtice properly, though there be not a full recompence, as in every point to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the injury done; I will but give you a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar illuſtration of it, that you may not ſay,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:175622:160"/>it is not unknown, and an unheard of thing, that juſtice is ſatisfied, although no plenary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence in the former ſenſe for ſatisfaction be brought. Suppoſe one man murther ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an ordinary caſe; now, for a plenary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence to the injury done, he that is ſlain muſt be <hi>in ſtatu quo prius,</hi> that is, he that is ſlain muſt be made alive again; and till that perſon ſlain be reſtored to life, here is not a compleat recompence made. But how is it poſſible, that any man that hath committed murther, ſhould make this full and plenary recompence to the perſon that is injured? He cannot reſtore life to him again; and yet for all this, although he cannot bring in a full recompence in this way, this man may properly ſatisfie juſtice: For, if life anſwer for life, if the murtherer be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Law and Juſtice may truly be ſaid to be ſatisfied. Here then they ſay, that there may be ſatisfaction of juſtice, and yet not the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of recompence in the ſtricteſt ſenſe brought in. Juſtice, I ſay, is ſatisfied in this reſpect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here is as much brought in by way of recompence, as is poſſible to be had. You know, beloved, you have a Proverb, <hi>Where there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be had, the King muſt loſe his right:</hi> when a man payes all that ever he hath, he can pay no more, he doth ſatisfie juſtice. In this ſenſe juſtice is ſaid to be ſatisfied, when the Law of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:175622:160"/>juſtice is ſatisfied; and ſo the ſatisfying of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice doth not neceſſarily imply the fulneſs of recompence in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, according to the injury done. How cometh it to paſſe, when a murtherer is executed, that upon this execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the murtherer onely, the Law doth eſteem this tobe a recompence, and juſtice to be ſatisfied, though it be not a plenary recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence anſwering the injury that is done; but onely as it anſwers to the Law, that is the rule of juſtice, ſo it is ſatisfaction: Even ſo, ſay they, the juſtice of God is truly ſatisfied, when the will and pleaſure of God is fulfilled, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no there be a bringing in a full and plenary recompence. If the will and pleaſure of God be ſatisfied, concerning tranſgreſſion, that ſatisfaction of the will of God, is the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the juſtice of God. Now, what is the will of God? It is this, that in the day that man ſins, man muſt die; either he muſt doe it in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or he muſt do it by deputation, for among men the ſatisfaction of the Law is made, either in the mans own perſon that is the debtor, or his ſurety that will pay the debt for him. The Law in ſome caſes, looks more upon the thing that is brought in to anſwer to it, than it doth upon the perſon that doth bring the thing in. The juſtice of God looks upon the fulfilling of his will, although it be not by the ſame perſon
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:175622:161"/>that ſinned; this alters not the nature of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:175622:161"/>and ſatisfier, that thereby the perſon of Chriſt is ſo glorious, that his active and paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is thereby made of infinite worth and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In brief, beloved, and ſo to conclude this buſineſſe, though there may be ſome hint given for your better underſtanding, by way of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration, how juſtice may be ſatisfied yet the truth is, the fulleſt and moſt ſatisfying reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith perſons ought ſit down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further diſpute, is not by argumentation, but by divine faith. Suppoſe wee could not ſound the bottome of this Principle, that Gods juſtice ſhould be ſatisfyed, yet we may ſit down as fully reſolved that it is ſatisfyed, though we know not how it ſhould be ſo, in that the Lord reveales to us he is ſatisfied, whoſe word muſt be more to us then all the evidences and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations in the world can be by way of Argument, that here Chriſt is ſaid to be the propitiation for our ſins, that God himſelf doth acknowledge elſe-where, that he is ſatisfied. What matter is it to me how he is ſatisfied; I mean, in reſpect of reſolving me by way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:175622:162"/>how he ſhould be ſatisfied, his own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If therefore all this while you cannot know how he is ſatisfied, your believing upon the teſtimony of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Word that it is ſo, may be as full a ſatifaction to you; yea may be, a more full reſolution to your ſpirits, then all the arguments and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations in the world can be.</p>
               <p>And ſo I come in brief, to the laſt clauſe of the Text; namely, the iſſue of this Advocateſhip of Chriſt, in the behalf of his people when they ſin. The iſſue is this, <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins;</hi> I ſay, the words containe in them the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, or the concluſion of the pleading of Chriſt, telling us what this pleading of Chriſt comes to at the laſt; it comes to this, that by this pleading of his, Chriſt becomes the propitiation for our ſins. The main thing to be conſidered here, that wee may underſtand aright our portion in this Grace, is to know what this propitiation meaneth, or what it is for Chriſt to be a propitiation. Beloved, there is abundance of marrow and fatneſſe in this very word, and I doubt much of it is loſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſenſe and comfort, for lack of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the extent of the word: That you may the better therefore dive into the myſterie
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:175622:162"/>of this Propitiation, you muſt underſtand, that the word in the originall <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is of the ſame originall and ſignification with the word the <hi>Septuagint</hi> tranſlation doth uſe, when they do interpret the Hebrew word that is rendred by Mercy-ſeat, for Mercy-ſeat is here Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>he is our Propitiation,</hi> that is, he is our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat. And if you would know in Scripture what it is for Chriſt to be our Mercy-ſeat, look into the 16. Chapter of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and the 14. and 15. verſes, you ſhall there finde the main end, for which this was erected by the Lord; For of all thoſe Ordinances that the Lord did eſtabliſh among the Jews this Mercy-ſeat was the uppermoſt. Now, if you mark in the 16. Chapter of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> you ſhall finde three things eſpecially appropriated unto the Mercy-ſeat.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the ſweet incenſe that none ought to make upon pain of death, but <hi>Aaron</hi> alone, that incenſe muſt burn upon the Golden Altar every morning before the Mercy-ſeat.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you ſhall finde that the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table of all the Rites and Types of the Jews, was to be prepared before the Mercy-ſeat, the Type of the <hi>Scape Goat</hi> with the <hi>Live Geat,</hi> as you may finde it regiſtered there, and handled at large in that Chapter. The <hi>Live Goat</hi> muſt be brought before the Mercy-ſeat, and <hi>Aaron</hi> muſt
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:175622:163"/>lay his hand upon the head of it, and, then the <hi>Scape Goat</hi> muſt be ſent into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſle, and carry the ſins of the people into a land of forgetfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, at this Mercy-ſeat, as it is in Exod. 30. chap. verſ. 6. the Lord did appoint to meet with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and there to ſpeak graciouſly unto him; and there God will hear him ſpeak, and God will be heard to ſpeak, and will return his gracious anſwer at the Mercy-ſeat. Well then, to come to the buſineſſe in hand, that I may cleer it the better; Chriſt is our Mercy-ſeat, that is, the incenſe, or the ſweet ſavour that ſmells with acceptance and delight in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils of the Lord, as I may ſo ſpeak; I ſay, that which makes a ſweet ſavour, is the Mercy-ſeat. Incenſe, had it been burned any where elſe, (but here according to the appointment and commiſſion of the Lord every morning) the very place it ſelf, being changed, would have taken away the ſavour of the Incenſe before the Lord, therefore the Mercy-ſeat is that for which the incenſe becomes a ſweet ſavour; as much as to ſay, all our prayers, and all our duties and ſervices (notwithſtanding our ſins, being believers (become as a ſweet ſavour to the Lord, as they are preſented up before the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat by Chriſt; he is the Propitiation then, that is, it is he by whom our perſons and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:175622:163"/>become a ſweet ſavour to the Lord, a ſweet incenſe. Again, the <hi>Scape Goat</hi> and the <hi>Live Goat</hi> to be ſlain, were to be prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mercy-ſeat, as much as to ſay, our ſins <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> cometh out of the mouth of my Son; there is not a word of comfort to be heard, but as it is ſpoken from the Mercy-ſeat; ſo that putting theſe three things together, in reſpect of the ſacrifice of the <hi>Scape Goat</hi> (the Text in <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> telling us of an atonement that is made by the preſenting of this ſacrifice before the Mercy-ſeat.) In a word, the ſum of all is this:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In and through Chriſt our Advocate, we become a ſweet favour to the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an atonement made with the Lord for us, our ſins being carryed into a land of forgetfulneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And in Chriſt, the Lord doth ſpeak all the gracious language of heaven, to us.</p>
               <p>Now, whereas at this Mercy-ſeat the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thing intimated unto us, is the atonement that is made. It ſeems that propitiation hath reference in the ſignification of it, to atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as when a man deſires one that is at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance with him, that he would be propitious, that is to ſay, he would admit of a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or atonement, Now, that you may know what atonement is, and ſo propitiation like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, Look into the 5. of the Romans, and the 9. and 10. verſes, there ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If

Mark what follows, <hi>and not only ſo but we rejoyce in God through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by whom we have received atonement:</hi> Firſt, you ſee he makes a Propoſition hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, by way of ſuppoſition: <hi>If when we were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him by whom we have received the atonement. What is atonement?

                  </gap> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot is, Propitiation indeed, comes at the laſt, or runs at the laſt into this ciſtern; namely, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God; herein lyeth the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the plea of Chriſt for his people commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſin: Chriſt is the Mercy-ſeat, the Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the Atonement, or Reconciliation. This is the iſſue of the plea of Chriſt; when Chriſt doth plead for diſcharge, this pleading pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth reconciliation between God and this perſon. If we could but dive into the myſterie of reconciliation between God and us, wee ſhould then finde the comfort of this Office of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:175622:165"/>Chriſt to be a propitiation for us. Now, if you will know what this reconciliation is, which is indeed an interpretation of propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: obſerve, I pray you, beloved, how the Apoſtle doth illuſtrate it in the 2. chapter of the Epiſtle to the Epheſians. and the 13. verſe: <hi>You that were ſometimes afar off, hath he made nigh by the blood of Chriſt.</hi> Reconciliation is making nigh thoſe perſons who were ſometimes afarre off; and that you may the better underſtand this being afarre off, look into the 1. chapter of the Epiſtle to the Coloſſians, the 21, and 22. verſes, the Apoſtle there will tell you, in what reſpect the members of Chriſt, the elect are ſaid to be afarre off: <hi>You who were ſometimes alienated, &amp; ſtrangers, &amp; enemies in your minds by wicked works, hath he now reconciled.</hi> So then to be afarre off, and of afarre off to be made, nigh, is as much as to ſay, that perſons who were alienated in reſpect of enmitie, in their mindes, in regard of wicked works, theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, notwithſtanding all that enmity, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of wicked works, they are made nigh, they are reconciled. You know well, in reſpect of the perſons of men, who are elected perſons, they are from all eternity in the purpoſe of God, made nigh by the vertue of the blood of Chriſt, that in time ſhould be ſhed, which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that blood is effectuall in the eyes and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:175622:165"/>thoughts of God from all eternity, ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in reſpect of the nature of wicked works there be a ſeparating and an alienating nature and quality, yet in regard of the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the blood of Chriſt, being in force with God, the perſons who are elected in the thoughts of God, are nigh to him in purpoſe, from eternity. So that alienation and eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in reſpect of eternity againſt God, is not to be underſtood, as if elect perſons were in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed, and properly at any time decreed to be ſeparated abſolutely from God; no, God had them in his thoughts, as the objects of his love from eternity, and theſe thoughts of being nigh were intended to be executed through that blood that was continually in his eye: <hi>But,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>you that were alienated in your mindes through wicked works;</hi> that is, you who ſo far forth as you wrought wicked works, had that in you, which in its own nature was the cauſe of alienation, and could not admit of your being neer, and being in the thoughts of Gods love, till there were reconciliation made: <hi>by Chriſt hath he made nigh;</hi> that is, whereas theſe wicked works were thoſe things that did in their own nature actually and for the preſent, make you walk at a diſtance from God, and ſo in reſpect of wicked works you were afarre off, you are now made nigh by the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:175622:166"/>blood of Chriſt, that is, Chriſt hath taken away ſin, the cauſe of that diſtance between God and you, and alſo hath revealed himſelf unto you, being Believers; and in revealing himſelf to you, he hath made known to you the eternall counſel of God concerning your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and that now you are actually and really in the very bowels of God, and alſo he doth in ſome meaſure ſubdue and deſtroy the power of Satan in thoſe wicked works; ſo that there is now a neerneſſe; I ſay, there is a more neerneſſe even in converſation with God, after calling and believing, then there was before calling; and the blood of Chriſt is that that make perſons who were far off, nigh again to God. And this is the reconciliation; namely, where as there was a diſtance before, there is now a neerneſſe; and this neernes is by the blood of Chriſt, as by a ſacrifice of propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. That you may the better underſtand the nature of reconciliation with God, you muſt know, that reconciliation properly imports thus much, that whereas there is variance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

You know, as long as there is hitting in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:175622:166"/>the teeth, as long as there is ſecret grudges, as long as there is objectings one againſt another, and proſecuting one another in reſpect of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done, ſo long there is not reconciliation; When men are reconciled they lay down the bucklers, they quarrell no more, they fight no more, but walk as friends together. And if they ſhould walk as friends in outward ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, and yet ſhould bear rancor in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits one againſt another, this were but an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall reconciliation.

                  </gap>cconciliation, the very heart it ſelf is made friends with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reconciled. All this imports unto us this much, Chriſt is become to beleevers the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one that makes a peace with God, he is he that ends the controverſie, and the quarrell, between God and them; whereas God was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, and might have proſecuted the Law with violence upon us, Chriſt doth bring to paſſe, that the Lord layes down the buckler, to have no more to ſay againſt a perſon, but to become friends with him. You know, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is ſuch a thing, as is not only a making friends to day, but a making friends ſo, that there may be a continuation of this amity. You cannot call this reconciliation, when men are brought together, and their controverſies are ended now to day, but upon the ſame controverſie they will fall out again
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:175622:167"/>to morrow, here is not reconciliation; for, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, there muſt be a burying of all that which was the ſubject &amp; matter of the quarrel. So Chriſt being our reconciliation, he making our peace with God, doth not bring God to be friends with us to day, ſo as to fall out with us to morrow again; but to be friends with us for ever. Therefore by the way know, that every perſon reconciled unto God by Chriſt, is not only a perſon becoming a friend of God now, but a friend of God for ever: And as Chriſt doth take away the preſent anger of God againſt him to day, ſo he takes away all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and controverſies for ever: So that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reconciled ſhall never have God at contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie any more with him. Some, it may be, do conceive, Chriſt doth reconcile God and us in reſpect of ſins that are paſt; but if I ſin anew, ſay they, God muſt have new controverſies, and new quarrels. But, beloved, remember this, he did bear all the iniquitie at once upon him; and when he made the reconciliation with God, he brought in all the trangreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, from firſt to laſt, and ſo ended the quarrel with God, in reſpect of every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, even for ſins future, as well as for thoſe that are paſt. He dealt ſo with God, that he did reconcile him to you in reſpect of them. So that Chriſt muſt either leave out thoſe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:175622:167"/>ſins you think breaks the peace with God in the agreement he made; or, if he did not leave them out, then that reconciliation doth as much concern thoſe ſins, as other tranſgreſſions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready committed. Now, think whether of theſe be true doctrine, either that Chriſt ſhould leave ſome ſins out, that are brought now again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to controverſie, and ſo God be again at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and begin to fall out with perſons for them; or whether he make agreement for all, and all comes into reconciliation. Therefore, I ſay, ſuppoſe two men are at variance, they have a hundred actions one againſt another; a friend comes in and agitates to make up the buſineſſe between them, he brings in every one of theſe hundred actions to this agreement, he dealeth ſo with them, that all the controverſie between them in reſpect of theſe actions ſhall die; and ſo he makes them friends. Now, I ask, when all the treſpaſſes and actions are brought into the agreement, may theſe men fall to quarrelling and ſuits of Law for any of theſe particulars brought into the agreement? They cannot do it, beloved, if Chriſt brought in all the tranſgreſſions of his people into the agreement, and they were all ſatisfied for, by him, every one of them: <hi>His blood cleanſeth from all ſin,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle: I ſay, if all were brought into agreement at once, how cometh
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:175622:168"/>it to paſſe, that God ſhould again fall out, and be at controverſie with men for any of theſe ſins that were in the agreement before in that reconciliation made? Therefore, know for certain, for your everlaſting and eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, that there is nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate you from the love of God in Chriſt, nothing ſhall make a breach between God and you, who are the people of God. Every ſin which in its own nature indeed makes a breach, is taken into the agreement that Chriſt makes with the Father; and if there ſhould be ſuch an objection riſing in your hearts when you haue committed a ſin, now God is at controverſie with me for this.

                  </gap>k your he arts this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Was this ſin brought into the agreement of reconciliation, or was it left out? Did God accept of the reconciliation when this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion was in the agreement? how can he then fall out again for this that was in his thoughts when reconciliation was made? But this may ſeem to be but diſcourſe only, and therefore take a view of ſome paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby you ſhall ſee as cleer as the light, that Gods reconciliation to men, is one entire and ſimple act. This reconciliation being once made, there is no more quarrell and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie that God ſhould proſecute theſe perſons reconciled. Look into the 9. Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:175622:168"/>and the 24. verſe, there is a time mentioned of making reconciliation; if you look into the Propheſie, you ſhall therein ſee the effects that do accompany the reconciliation made. I have heretofore recited other effects unto you, but not this: <hi>Seventy weeks</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon thy people and holy City;</hi> for what? <hi>for the finiſhing of tranſgreſſion, for the making an end of ſin, and making reconciliation for ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and bringing in of everlaſting righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> Obſerve it well, when reconciliation is made, then there is an end of the matter that did breed and feed the controverſie and quarrell. When there is a controverſie of God againſt a perſon, the controverſie muſt ſpring from the ſins of that perſon; but when there is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation made, there is a finiſhing of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a putting an end to ſin. Take away the cauſe and the effect vaniſheth of it ſelf; but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Text a little more yet to ſhew the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſſe of this reconciliation, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is made, there is, ſaith he, in the next word, <hi>brought in everlaſting righteouſnes.</hi> Righteouſneſſe, as you have heard before, is that that doth both beget, and feed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve peace and reconciliation with God. So then, this fountain of righteouſneſſe muſt bee drawn dry, before the peace that is made by this fountain can be waſted. How comes it to

Conſider alſo that excellent expreſſion in 54. of Iſa. in the 9. and 10. verſes: <hi>This is to me,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>as the waters of Noah: For, as I have ſworn that the waters of Noah ſhal no more go over the earth; ſo have I ſworn that I wil not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee any more; the mountains ſhal depart, and the hils ſhal be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but my loving kindnes ſhal not depart from thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>that hath mercy on thee.</hi> The very expreſſe words ſhew the excellent qualities of that reconciliation that is produced by the bringing in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mark it well, I beſeech you, for there are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable expreſſions in it: The thing God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims is this, That he will not be wroth; that he will not fall out any more with his people; and this thing the Lord confirms by an oath: <hi>as I have ſworn that the waters of Noah ſhall be no more upon the earth: ſo have I ſworn I will not he wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee any more.</hi>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:175622:169"/>You ſee here the confirmation of it by an oath, and what can be more binding then the oath of God?</p>
               <p>Well, ſecondly, take notice of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this: <hi>He hath ſworn, and will not be wroth, nor rebuke,</hi> but how long will not he be wroth, nor rebuke? Even ſo long as flouds ſhall ceaſe to drown the world. God hath ſworn, that till the world ſhall be drowned with water again, God will not be wroth with his people; ſo ſaith the Text: As long as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall not come upon the earth, nay longer, if longer may be, <hi>The mountains ſhall depart, and the hills ſhall be removed, but my loving kindnes ſhall not depart from thee</hi> as much as to ſay, the loving kindneſſe of God ſhall remain ſtedfaſt to the people reconciled to him, even longer then the mountains ſhall ſtand faſt, and the hills unremoved. This I ſay is eſtabliſhed by ſuch a firm covenant, by ſuch an oath, and out of the mouth of ſo glorious a Lord, that the hearts of Gods people may be eſtabliſhed and ſecure, that God will not be wroth with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But where as ſome may ſay the Lord ſpeaks in this place, in the 17. verſe, <hi>In a little wrath have I hid my face for a moment;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems it is not to be taken for ſuch a perpetuall forbearance of wrath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Conſider, that all along this Chapter
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:175622:170"/>the Prophet ſpeaks of the Church of God, in a two-fold eſtate: he ſpeaks to it one while as it is a wife of youth; and another while, as her breaſts are grown: As a wife of youth; ſo the Lord for a moment hid his face; but as a wiſe that is grown up, ſo the Lord will not be wroth with her, nor rebuke her any more. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth moſt excellently expound this different eſtate of the Church, in the time before and after Chriſt: In the 3. Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Galatians, and the latter end of that Chapter, and the beginning of the 4. Chapter, There was, ſaith he, a time of mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, wherein, even an heir, being but a childe, differeth nothing at all, in reſpect of outward carriage from a ſervant, though even then he be Lord of all. In the 4. Chap. and verſe 1. to the Galatians, and this time of being a ſervant, is not for ever, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>but till the time appointed of the Father.</hi> Here, in reſpect of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward uſage, during this minority, there is no difference between ſuch a perſon, and him that is not an heir at all, but he is under Tutors, and Governours, that is, he feels alike of the rod, and ſtill this is till the time appointed of the Father: See how the Apoſtle expounds the words, even ſo <hi>we</hi> ſaith he, <hi>while we were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in our non-age, were in bondage under the elements of the world;</hi> we did partake of the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:175622:170"/>common calamities of the world, but how long was this? <hi>VVhen the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> There was a redemption, even in the minority of the Church, when the Church was at the youngeſt age, there was redemption, but not a redemption in reſpect of that which he ſpeakes of here, that was a redemption from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein the heire did not differ from a ſervant; therefore, moſt properly, according to the coherence of the words, the redemption moſt properly and ſpecially ſpoken of here, was a redemption from a condition wherein they did not differ from ſervants, into a condition wherein they ſhould differ. So in the 54. Chap. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> verſe 8. there is ſuch a difference in this two- fold eſtate of the Church, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a wife of youth, and a wife grown up; What is that, you will ſay? I anſwer, you know, even among men, they marry children when they are but two or three yeares of age; the childe, ſhe is a married wife, and yet for all this, while ſhe is foure or five, yea, ſix or ſeven yeers of age, ſhe is uſed as one that is not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, there is no difference between this childe and one that is not married, both are corrected, and both are whipped; but when ſhe cometh
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:175622:171"/>to riper yeers of age, and hath the actuall fruition of her husband, then ſhe cometh to be freed from the rod, and receiveth all the immunities and priviledges of a wife, which ſhe, though a wife, did not enjoy before: And ſo in this Text, the Church as a childe under age, and wife of youth, is viſited for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there is a kind of hiding the face of God while ſhe is as the wife of youth; but when the time of riper age is come, then <hi>this ſhall be as the waters of</hi> Noah <hi>to me; as I have ſworn that the waters of</hi> Noah <hi>ſhall no more drown the earth; ſo have I ſworn that I will not be worth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</hi> Thus beloved, you ſee, that God once reconciled, he never falls out with his people any more. It is true indeed, he doth chaſtiſe them, hee doth correct them, but he never doth it in wrath, he never doth it in ſury. In the 27. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the 4. verſe, ſpeaking of his Church, that he would watch it night and day, he ſaith, <hi>fury is not in me;</hi> he hath no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with fury, in reference unto ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And therefore, although it be true, there may be afflictions, and theſe afflictions may be exceeding tart to the fleſh; even when a perſon is grown, and when a Church is grown up; yet notwithſtanding there is not wrath in theſe afflictions: <hi>Every ſonne,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:175622:171"/>God, <hi>I love, I rebuke and chaſten:</hi> There is love even in chaſtiſements, and the fruit of it is love, to take away ſinne. The end why God ſends theſe afflictions, is not in wrath for ſinne, but to purge them from their filth. God takes occaſion when his people doe ſinne, to chaſtiſe them in love; but that chaſtiſement is no fruit of the wrath of God, it is no fruit of the curſe of God, nor ſentence of the Law, but the tender compaſſions of a loving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that makes uſe of them for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens good: There is as much reconciliation with God under the rod, as when perſons are not under the rod: A father may love a childe as dearely when hee corrects him, as when he gives him plums. It is thus with God, children reconciled to him, as he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects a child committing a fault, he never whips him but there is feare he will commit it againe; and therefore he doth chaſtiſe him to prevent a fault; He doth not puniſh him to pacifie his anger for the fault committed. So God, in reſpect of the Church, for the purging of his Church, and for triall in theſe reſpects, he will chaſtiſe, and in chaſtiſing he will convey the Spirit of amendment to them; but in reſpect of what is done, were it not to have them purged for the future, he would never afflict his people for that which is paſt. So that, I
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:175622:172"/>ſay, though this be the great Objection that troubles mens ſpirits, they fall daily into troubles and afflictions, here is wrath and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, reconciliation is not firm, God is now fallen out; yet, beloved, know, that God is not fallen out with his people when he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeth them. No man under Heaven can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer under afflictions, more then Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did; yet, ſaith God, hee is my beloved Son, not my hated Son, but my beloved Son, I afflict. It is true indeed, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks: <hi>No affliction at firſt ſeems joyous, but grievous;</hi> yet, <hi>afterwards it bringeth forth the pleaſant fruits of righteouſneſſe to thoſe that are exerciſed therewith.</hi> Conſider this one thing; Can God poure wrath when he intends one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the good of his people, to purge his people, to bring them as gold out of the fire? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, what <hi>David</hi> had experience of, ſhall be the fruit of all the afflictions of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, though they be never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and great: <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went aſtray, but now I have learned to keep thy Laws.</hi> Whereupon hee ſaith, that it was good for him he was afflicted. God afflicts to teach, God afflicts to draw home, God afflicts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine and purge: You know, the Merchant doth not in wrath fling away his gold, when he puts it into the refining pot; it is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:175622:172"/>of leſſe love, onely he would have his gold tried and refined, and the droſſe taken away out of it: It is ſo with God; all the members of Chriſt, all that Chriſt hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed for with the Father, they are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of the Father, and the darlings of his ſoule, and his love ceaſeth not; nay, his love diminiſheth not to them when they are under the rod.</p>
               <p>One word of application, and ſo I ſhall have done: Is it ſo, beloved, that Chriſt is ſuch an Advocate, that having ſuch a ſtrength of plea in his righteouſneſſe, he produceth ſuch a good iſſue, as to bring at the laſt, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation? In a word then, you know what to truſt unto for your ſoules diſcharge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: <hi>In many things wee ſin all;</hi> what ſhould uphold your ſpirits, that your ſinnes ſhould not ſink your ſoules? Here is held out unto you the great Supporter, the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſſe of God: <hi>I will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thee with the right hand of thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> Iſaiah 41. verſ. 10. <hi>feare not, be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged;</hi> and why? the cloſe of all is this; <hi>I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe:</hi> If you goe any where elſe for ſupport, when ſin is committed, your ſins will ſink you, and ſwallow you up, nothing can beare you up in reſpect of the weight of ſin, but the right
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:175622:173"/>hand of his righteouſneſſe; that alone is the thing that muſt uphold your ſpirits; or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all can doe it; O that the Lord would be pleaſed to work upon your ſpirits, to betake your ſelves to this ſupport, and to fix your ſpirits upon the fulneſſe of ſupport and ſtrength, that is, in this righteouſneſſe of his. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſtung by the fiery Serpents, it was not the applying of a plaiſter could heal them, only the brazen Serpent could heal them, and nothing but the brazen Serpent. Oh, look upon the brazen Serpent, the Lord Jeſus; look not upon any other plaiſter in the world, but him, to heal your wounded ſoules ſtung with the Serpent of your ſins; though they may ſerve for other uſes, yet they have not ſo much vertue in them, as to heale the ſting of ſin: Fix your eyes here, caſt your ſelves here, reſt here, let the weight of your ſouls lean here: <hi>Hee that believeth ſhall be ſaved; hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be damned; He that believeth ſhall be eſtabliſhed; hee that believeth not, ſhall not be eſtabliſhed.</hi> Oh, go not to Chriſt, as if there were not enough in him to anſwer your tranſgreſſions, that you muſt carry ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe with you to him, that may be a help to your diſcharge; if ever diſcharge from heaven come unto your ſpirits, it is onely the hand of Chriſt by his Spirit, that muſt
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:175622:173"/>bring it down to you; and nothing in the world can doe it, but that diſcharge, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Word of Grace, in things that come by relation unto men, and ſo are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto them. How can men be ſatisfied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the thing reported, but upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of him that is the reporter, thereof to ſit down ſatisfied by faith concerning the truth thereof? Let a man tell me never ſo good news, if I doe not believe him, my ſpirit is not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. So, concerning the diſcharge from ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, you heare it related from heaven: <hi>Wee have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> Now, there is no way in the world to know that there is ſuch a thing as an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and Propitiation, but as it is revealed from heaven. The Apoſtle <hi>Iohn:</hi> hee indeed reveales it here; if hee had delivered it meerly as hee is man, ſo it had occaſioned ſuſpicion and doubting, but as it is the revelation of the Holy Ghoſt, and of Chriſt himſelfe by the Apoſtle, ſo wee are to ſtick cloſe unto it, and wee ſhall finde reſt unto our ſoules, as wee can credit the report of it; therefore as the Lord will work upon your ſpirits, take up your reſt where reſt is to be found; ſo your ſouls ſhall reſt, you ſhall lie down and ſleep in peace and ſafety, you ſhall ſing and leap for joy; and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:175622:174"/>you ſhall have all peace, and joy in believing. O that men would keep up the dying lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a Martyr: <hi>None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt,</hi> in matters of faith, and ſtability of ſpirit; in matters of peace of conſcience, as well as in matters of ſalvation, And ſo I ſhall commend this word to the grace of God, in reſpect of the iſſue thereof upon your ſpirits.</p>

Sometimes again, the Goſpel was preſented, though not with ſo darke masks, yet with a vail over the viſage and face of it, that though ſome of the beauty of it might be ſeen, yet in reſpect of the glory of it, in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure way; and thus the Goſpel was exhibited unto the <hi>Jewes</hi> in their types and ſhadowes,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:175622:175"/>and thus the Goſpel was held forth in their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, Temples, Tabernacles, Altars, Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat, and Incenſe, and the like: In all of which there was a generall darkneſſe; namely, a put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the face of <hi>Moſes</hi> a vail, who in that repreſented Chriſt the Mediator, as he was to be exhibited unto the people in thoſe times; and yet, although for royalty and honours ſake, the Goſpel was vailed; yet ſometimes the Holy Ghoſt was pleaſed to lift up the vail for a moment, as it were, that there might ſome glance of the beauty of it appeare; Even in thoſe times, now and then, a Prophet would out with ſome admirable expreſſion of the Goſpel: But this was but as the breaking forth of light in a darke night. Sometimes again, the Goſpel was preſented in a Propheticall habit, and ſo it was held out, as it were, at a remote diſtance, that even an elevated and ſupernaturall eye had as much as it could do to ſee it in the proportion of the Goſpel. And this was the diſpenſation of the Goſpel in the Prophets. Sometimes alſo the Goſpel was preſented under a parabolicall habit; and thus it pleaſed our Saviour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit it in his time, delighting much to ſee it in this dreſſe: in ſo much, that all the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel he ſpake, almoſt, was clothed in that habit; and ſo the kingdome of heaven was likened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Leaven, hid in three meaſures of meal, and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:175622:176"/>unto Muſtard-ſeed, and unto Treaſure hid in a field, and ſo he goeth on, ſetting of it forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all ſorts of compariſons to illuſtrate it. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the Goſpel is preſented ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either vail or mask over it, in its owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per beauty, ſhining forth from the face of it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all hindering the proſpect of it, in its own proportion; and thus was the Goſpel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto the Diſciples, when they ſaid unto Chriſt: <hi>Now thou ſpeakeſt unto us plainly, and not by Parables.</hi> Unto us that live now, at this preſent the Goſpel of Chriſt is repreſented in all theſe variety of dreſſes together to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the more delight. It is accounted one of the greateſt pieces of honour in a State for a Prince to have changes of rayment every day. Now, the Lord will put ſo much ſtate upon his Goſpel, that it ſhal not always go in one dreſſe or habit</p>
               <p>Now, the Text that I have read unto you, holds out the Goſpel in Chriſts owne way, which was ſo much affected by him, I mean, in a parabolicall habit. The moſt glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the Goſpel, as it doth pertain to the Church of God, are compoſed in this Text: <hi>Thou art all fair my Love, there is no ſpot in thee.</hi> This text, as the whole ſong throughout, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an elevated ſtrain of diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and his Church, or a ſong tuned to the higheſt note that ever ſong was ſung;
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:175622:176"/>which diſcourſe is an interchangeable ſpeech between Chriſt and his Church; the Church acting her part firſt, in the ſecond verſe of the firſt Chapter: <hi>Let him kiſſe me with the kiſſes of his mouth;</hi> being amiable ſweet diſcourſe indeed: then ſhe falls upon the high commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this love of hers, exalting the praiſe of her husband Chriſt above the skie, which kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſuch a ſtrong affection in her, that ſhe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be far from him, that ſhe was not neere enough unto him; ſhe called unto him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that hee would draw her neerer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: <hi>Draw me, and wee will run after thee,</hi> ſaith the Church. And that ſhe may come the neerer, ſhe begs of him, to tell her where ſhe may finde him in a neerer communion with him than yet ſhe had. Hereupon, her part being ended, Chriſt he begins to tune his note to an higher ſtrain, in anſwering the Church, than the Church began to him: If thou knoweſt not, <hi>O thou faireſt among women,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; here after his commendation of her, he directs her where ſhe may meet with him; by the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of the flocks; by the tents of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, there ſhe ſhall have him. And then he falls again upon the exalting and commending of her excellent perfections, by many and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall compariſons: the Church by and by in the 16. verſe, retorts the commendation that
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:175622:177"/>Chriſt gives unto her, upon Chriſt againe: <hi>My Beloved is fair; Behold, my Beloved is all fair, and pleaſant.</hi> Thus you ſee, here is a making forth of the praiſes of each others excellency, and of the high eſteem each hath of other, each to other in their mutuall diſcourſe: Chriſt ſaith of the Church, <hi>Thou art the faireſt among women;</hi> the Church ſhe replies againe, <hi>Behold, thou art fair;</hi> and thus they go on in admirable expreſſions of the praiſes of each other. I would be too large to run over all the particulars of the ſweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between Chriſt and his Church Now in the Text, Chriſt retorts that commendation back againe unto the Church, that the Church before had given unto him: Thus ſhe having begun to fall into the high commendation of her love, he afterwards follows, <hi>O thou faireſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong women;</hi> ſhe retorts it upon him, <hi>Thou art fair my Love, thou art all fair.</hi> Well, Chriſt will not have it reſt there, he will have the laſt word, as I may ſay, he retorts it back againe to her, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the words of the Text: <hi>Thou art all fair my Love, there is no ſpot in thee:</hi> So that here is an out-vying, as it were, between Chriſt and his Church, which ſhould mount higheſt in the praiſe of each other, extolling the excellency of each other unto the skies; the burthen of the ſong being this ſtill: <hi>Thou art fair; thou art all fair my Love.</hi> In the words themſelves, you
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:175622:177"/>may obſerve in generall, the high commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Chriſt gives of his Church, and unto the Church her ſelf; in which commendation, you may note:</p>
               <p>Firſt, the moſt gracious amiable title that Chriſt gives unto her, he calls her <hi>Love,</hi> the ſweeteſt title a Husband can give a Wife; but there is an addition of one Article that doth mightily advance the indearedneſſe of Chriſt, in reſpect of the ſpecialty thereof; namely, <hi>MY LO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E; thou art all fair, MY LO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, note here in the words, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the praiſe, and commendation that Chriſt gives to his Church, it is expreſſed in that which is accounted moſt deſireable; <hi>fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; thou art fair;</hi> but in this matter of praiſe there is a double addition that doth exceed the praiſe the Church gives unto Chriſt before. The Church is not only fair, but <hi>all fair; Thou art all fair, my Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, for the further illuſtration of this beauty, there is a ſecond addition; <hi>Thou art all fair, thou haſt no ſpot in thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, in the words you may note the time of which Chriſt ſpeaks: Every man receives this Principle, that in glory in Heaven, there ſhall be perfection of beauty, in which the Church ſhall ſtand. But if Chriſt had ſpoken of the ſtate of glory, he would have declared
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:175622:178"/>himſelf in the future Tenſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt be all fair my Love.</hi> But it is obſerveable, Chriſt ſpeakes here in the preſent Tenſe, of the preſent time of the Church, as he hath communion with her here in this world: <hi>Thou art all fair.</hi> There is a great deale of difference between the Tenſes. It is one thing to ſay of a man, Thou ſhalt be rich, and another thing to ſay, Thou art rich. It is true, the Church ſhall be all fair in glory, and it is as true, the Church is all fair now: <hi>Thou art all fair my Love, there is no ſpot in thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That theſe words are the language of Chriſt unto his Church, may appear to you, if you will conſider.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what is ſpoken before; there is the commendation of the breaſts. Now, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of breaſts hath reference to the Spouſe; but moſt plainly it appeares in the words that follow the Text, in the 8. verſe, <hi>Come with me from Lebanon my Spouſe,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; either they muſt be the words of Chriſt to the Church, or they muſt be the words of the Church to Chriſt; but they cannot be the words of the Church to Chriſt, for the Church doth not call Chriſt the Spouſe; for the word Spouſe is ſpoken in reference to the woman, and not to the man. You ſhall have it further cleered in the contents of the chapter, which ſhew the drift of the whole chapter, the Author
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:175622:178"/>of the contents holds forth according to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> where the Genders are more diſtinct then in our Engliſh; that theſe very words are the expreſſions of Chriſt unto his Church. Whereby you ſee that this is no new doctrine, neither is it ſet forth by any obſcure perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered by <hi>Solomon,</hi> or rather by Chriſt perſonated by <hi>Solomon,</hi> that the Church ſhould be all fair and without ſpot.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition is briefly this: <hi>That the Love of Chriſt is all fair, and without ſpot,</hi> You may remember, beloved, that I have hitherto at large indeavoured to ſet forth the Goſpel of our bleſſed Saviour to you, in the firſt great part thereof (the Goſpel conſiſting princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in two things, the negative and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative priviledges of the members of Chriſt their great priviledge, and invaluable benefit, being, firſt, exemption from evill; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a participating of all good things.) All the diſcourſe I have had with you hitherto, hath had reference principally to the former branch of the Goſpel, ſetting forth to you the gracious diſcharge of the members of Chriſt from all miquity; and ſo conſequently from all the fruits of iniquity in theſe words: <hi>And the Lord bath laid on him the iniquity of us all;</hi> and I have further ſhewed you, how the people of God, and members of Chriſt, do partake of ſuch
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:175622:179"/>diſcharge as this is, which is the way of God, by which the ſons of men, Believers, can have their portion, and their poſſeſſion of this immunity: and that out of the Text of <hi>Iohn: If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was in my thoughts, beloved, to have made preſent progreſſe into the Text that I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> unto you; but yet in ſome reſpect a neceſſary lies upon me to give you a brief touch of ſome things I have formerly delivered, by way of acquitting my ſelf from injurious ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. It is, and hath heen my portion, and I know, not unknown to many of you, that while I have laboured freely, and by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit of the Lord, indeavoured to make known the minde of the Lord to the comfort and reſt of the weary and heavy laden, I my ſelf have not wanted my burthen; yet, were it not for the Goſpels ſake, leſt that ſhould receive prejudice, I ſhould never open my mouth to vindicate a truth, as it doth concern my ſelf, in ſo publick a way. But as there hath been moſt falſe imputations laid upon me, in reſpect of the Goſpel; ſo for the Goſpels ſake only, I ſhall acquit my ſelf publikely before you of ſuch things as are moſt injuriouſly charge upon me. It hath been affirmed, and that by
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:175622:179"/>perſons, who have gone for perſons of credit, (and conſequently the wound muſt ſtrike the deeper, and the report muſt take the greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) it hath been given forth, I ſay, that in my diſcourſe among you, I ſhould deliver to you, that the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt conſidered as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is Chriſt conſidered both as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and man, that the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt, in reſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to both his natures, hath not a ſufficiency in it to make up a compleat righteouſneſſe for us; and further, that the ground of it ſhould be this; Namely, that Chriſt did not perform the ſeverall duties of the ſeverall relations wherein many perſons ſtand; as the office of a Magiſtrate, and the relation of a Husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the vindicating of my ſelf herein, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the matter I delivered before, and you ſhall alſo know the truth of what my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in this thing; and then leave it to the Church of God, whether it be a ſlander or no. This I then ſaid; that the active and paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt properly, are the actions and paſſions of the humane nature; for the divine nature is not ſubject to obedience, becauſe there is not any ſuperiour to whom the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould obey; neither is it ſubject to paſſion, God cannot ſuffer, and therefore doing the commands, and ſuffering the puniſhments, are
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:175622:180"/>more proper to the actions of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And this humane nature is but a meer creature, and therefore the actions of it as a creature, cannot extend to a proportion an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the injurie done by ſin to God: For this cauſe, I ſay, as I ſaid before, there muſt be an addition of vertue from the divine nature of Chriſt to make the active and paſſive obedience of the humane nature a compleat righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. So that all I ſaid is this: That the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and paſſions of the humane nature, are not ſufficient to make up our righteouſneſſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat righteouſneſſe, but there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the divine nature ſuperadded to raiſe up a righteouſneſſe proportionable to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions we commit. And that expreſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the not performing of duties of theſe ſeveral relations; I ſpake it only to this purpoſe, to ſhew wherein the humane nature of Chriſt in obedience, did not fulfill every thing in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, which is the duty of a man; and that therefore the divine nature of Chriſt by the eminent dignity thereof, is, as I ſaid before, to make up that righteouſneſſe a compleat righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. Concerning this, whether it be truth or no, let the Church judge, according to the word: As for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Chriſt as God and man, it is well known, I uſed not the word, neither had I the thing in my minde, nor
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:175622:180"/>in my tongue to the purpoſe they alledge it againſt me. In a word, this I ſay, that Chriſt as God and man, hath in himſelf an abſolute compleatneſſe of righteouſneſſe, for all the elect perſons. There need not be a going forth from Chriſt to any thing in the world beſides for a perfect righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is another charge deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and I appeal to you that have frequently heard me, whether ever you have heard any ſuch thing from me; Namely, that by way of inference I ſhould deny Chriſt, How true this is, let the whole courſe of my Miniſtery wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which altogether aimed and endeavoured the exalting of Chriſt above all the creatures in the world, and except my being ſo buſie with this truth be become an occaſion of ſo manifeſt ſlanders and falſe aſperſions that are raiſed, I know not what ſhould be the cauſe of them. But, beloved, how is it, that I ſhould deny Chriſt? In that, ſay they, I deny repentance unto life. Now, whether ever I did ſo, I appeal to you that heard me: This I ſay, concerning faith and repentance unto life, in brief that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faith nor repentance hath any efficacy of their own to produce life, but thoſe that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to life, in time the Lord giveth them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and repent indeed.</p>
               <p>But a third charge is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more ſtrange then all
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:175622:181"/>the reſt, this I muſt touch alſo. I will name no perſons, nor hint them; but my ſcope is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver plainly unto you, the truth of my own thoughts, and ſo lie under cenſure, or be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted. The charge is this, that I ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that an elect perſon ſhould live and die a whoremonger, and an adulterer; and in all kinde of propitaneneſſe; and, though living and dying in this kinde of prophaneneſſe, he ſhall be ſaved. Which, how contrary it is unto the whole courſe of my miniſtery, ye are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I dare be bold to ſay, you all know it to be a groſſe, notorious, and groundleſſe ſlander. You know, concerning this thing; an elect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo being an elect perſon, it is impoſſible that ſuch an one ſhould miſ-carry, and not be ſaved. He that is elected unto ſalvation, either Gods election muſt be fruſtrated, which is impoſſible, or this perſon muſt attain unto ſalvation. I think no man of thoſe that have caſt this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puntion upon me will deny it; but withall, this I ſaid before, and ſo I ſay ſtill. There is no elect perſon, ſuppoſe him to be capable, and come to yeers, ſhall die before he be called, that is, before the Lord give faith to this perſon to beleeve, and in ſome mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure frame this elect perſon to walk by the Spirit according to the ruſe of the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it. In a word, this perſon is changed in converſation. The principle is this:
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:175622:181"/>
                  <hi>He that beleeveth ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not ſhall be damned:</hi> and, <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>unclera thing ſhall enter into the Kingdom of heaven;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſoul therefore, being elected, as it ſhall be ſaved at laſt, ſo is it, or ſhall in time be called and inabled to beleeve and walk as a child of light, If this be not true doctrine, then I deſire my mouth may be ſtopped.</p>
               <p>Having thus endeavoured to take off thoſe aſperſions, though not in reſpect of my ſelf; yet in reſpect of ſome of you, who peradventure may receive ſuch things for truth, eſpecially coming out of the mouths of ſuch perſons as thoſe from whom the charge comes.</p>
               <p>Now, to the Text that I have taken to my ſelf to handle; namely, <hi>Thou art all fair my Love, there is no ſpot in thee.</hi> I ſhall ſay but little concerning this latter branch of the Text, it having been all my work heretofore to ſet forth this immunity we have by the blood of Chriſt, the cleanſing from all ſin. I ſhall keep my ſelf to the former branch: <hi>Then art all fair my Love.</hi> Let us therefore take into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe particulars, that will give ſome hint of the grace revealed here.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, who this <hi>Love</hi> is, of whom Chriſt ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>Secondly, why this perſon that is ſo fair is here called <hi>my Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:175622:182"/>
               <p>Thirdly, what this <hi>fairneſſe</hi> is that is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the love of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, what it is for the love of Chriſt to be <hi>all fair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, when this time is, that this love of Chriſt is all fair: <hi>Thou art all fair my Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will begin here with the firſt; namely, who this is here, that is called the <hi>Love</hi> of Chriſt. The next words will unriddle the queſtion, <hi>Come with me from Lebanon my Spouſe.</hi> The love of Chriſt then here, is the Spouſe of Chriſt. And, beloved, if you knew all, you would ſoon ſee what glorious, unſpeakable and unſearchable excellencies are contained in this Grace, that the Church ſhould be admitted into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of Chriſt to be the very Spouſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There are two things very conſiderable by which you may perceive at the leaſt ſome of the glory and excellency of this priviledge, to be the Spouſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if you conſider the inequality of the perſons that are matched.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you will conſider the great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge that will iſſue from ſuch a match as this is. The word <hi>Spouſe,</hi> you know, is nothing elſe, but a title of relation, in reference to a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Now, I ſay, firſt conſider the inequality of the perſons matched, and therein you ſhall ſee an admirable condeſeending and grace. I
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:175622:182"/>remember, in the firſt book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> when the ſervants of <hi>Saul</hi> came to <hi>David,</hi> to make mention of <hi>Sauls</hi> mind concerning <hi>Davids</hi> marrying <hi>Sauls</hi> daughter, <hi>David</hi> was in a kind of aſtoniſhment, and amazement. And when they ſpake to him of the matter, <hi>David</hi> replied: <hi>Seemeth it a light matter unto you, to be the kings ſon in law, ſeeing I am a poor man, and my father of a ſmall houſe in</hi> Iſrael. This was ſtrange news to poor <hi>'David;</hi> What? preſently to marry the Kings daughter, and to be the ſon in law to a King, being a poor man as I am, is this a ſmall matter in your eyes? Much more may we be aſtoniſhed, that we poor miſerable wretches ſhould marry the ſon and heir of the world; nay, the Son and Heir of Glory. Shall this ſeem a light matter to you to be the Spouſe of a King, to be the ſons and daughters of the King of kings? It was an admirable witty expreſſion of <hi>Abigail</hi> in the 25. Chapter of the firſt book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> verſ. 41. when <hi>David</hi> ſent meſſengers unto her, to commune with her, to take her to be his wife, <hi>Abigail</hi> in humility, replied to the meſſengers thus: <hi>Let thy hand-maid be a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to waſh the feet of the ſervants of my Lord;</hi> a high ſtrained complement, if it had been a meer complement: But it was reall, ſo it doth expreſſe the great diſtance ſhe conceived there was between her ſelf and <hi>David;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Oh then, beloved, what muſt be the condeſcending of the Son of God, the Heir of the world, and the expreſſe Image of the Father, and the brightneſſe of his glory, as you have it in the 3. verſe of the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> I ſay, for this great Heir, this mirror of Beauty, the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſle of the glory of the Father, to ſtoop to match himſelf to a creature; ſurely, I ſay it were a great condeſcending. But ſince he was ſo pleaſed to condeſcend ſo low, as to match himſelf to a creature, he might well have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the higheſt linage of the creatures, the higheſt and moſt noble ſtock of creatures, he
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:175622:183"/>might have matched himſelf with Angels, but this makes his condeſent more admitable; he deſcended lower, he took not upon him, ſaith the Apoſtle, the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And, beloved, were it to creatures, and the loweſt of creatures ſimply, the conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent had not been ſo great, there may be ſome beauty in a countrey maid, though homely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, as well as there may be in a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage in richeſt apparrell, being of great ſtock, and portion. Had there been beauty, though there had been no linage nor noble blood, this were ſomething; but as this blood became ignoble and traiterous blood, in reſpect of the firſt fathers rebellions, and treaſon, ſo this trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous blood could not contain it ſelf within its bounds; but, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>from the crown of the head, to the ſole of the feet, there is nothing elſe but wounds, &amp; bruiſes-ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and ſoars, and loathſomneſſe in blood, even ſuch a blood, as that perſon is caſt out to the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of its perſon, that no ey can pitty:</hi> That Chriſt ſhould take ſuch a naſty beggar, ſuch a beggar, as ſtinks above ground, as we may well ſay, in regard of its filthineſſe, that hath no ſound part, but being full of botches and ſoares, and putrifactions, running over all parts, from head to foot; I ſay, that Chriſt ſhould take ſuch a creature, and no place ſhould ſerve this
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:175622:184"/>creature but his boſome, his bed; and no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, no fellowſhip ſerve, but the neereſt communion and fellowſhip that poſſible may or can be imagined, even a communion and fellowſhip that extends it ſelf to a kind of one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and higheſt degree of unity.

Beloved, by nature, every perſon, till Chriſt himſelf tame that perſon, hath a ſpight againſt Chriſt, and ſights againſt him, and is ſo full of malignity againſt him, as to caſt dirt even in the face of Chriſt; and yet for all this inequality and diſproportion between Chriſt
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:175622:185"/>and the Spouſe, Chriſt makes this perſon, this loathſome wretched perſon, this rebell and traitor, his Spouſe.</p>
               <p>Now, beloved, if the Lord will but open your ſpirits, to look into this inequality, and diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and ſee not only the diſtance, but even the extream contrariety between Chriſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as he is in himſelf, and you in your ſelves, how can you but break forth into admiration and amazement, even to aſtoniſhment?</p>
               <p>It was a notable expreſſion of <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the 1. Epiſt. Chap. 3. as I take it, verſ. 1. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what manner of love this is, that the Father hath ſnewed unto us, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God? Now we are the ſons of God; and yet doth it not yet appear what we ſhall be.</hi> He begins with this note of admiration, <hi>Behold,</hi> and he follows it with an interrogation, as not being able to anſwer it himſelf, <hi>What manner of love is this?</hi> why, wherein expreſſed? <hi>That we ſhould be called the ſons of God.</hi> This is a great love, and yet ye know that ſon-ſhip is a relation below a Spouſe; How then ſhould we break forth, if it were poſſible, into a higher admiration then ever <hi>Iohn</hi> did, and ſay: <hi>Behold, what a manner of love is this, that we, poor miſerable creatures, ſhould be called the Spouſe of Chriſt! Now we are the Spouſe of Chriſt; yet doth it not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what we ſhall be.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:175622:185"/>
               <p>It remains we ſhould conſider, ſecondly, the priviledges of this relation, and therein ſee the great loving kindneſſe, and unſearchable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our God, that is pleaſed to match his own Son unto us, and by ſuch a match to make us partakers of ſuch excelient and glorious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and immunities. I will but name them:</p>
               <p>Firſt, as we are the Spouſe of Chriſt, ſo we are the children of God; he that marrieth the kings daughter, becometh the kings ſon by that match: but that is not all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by this match we become heirs; if ſons, then heirs, heirs of glory, co-heirs, and joynt-heirs with Chriſt; a great priviledge, if you conſider of all the wealth and ſiches you have by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this Spouſeſhip intitles the Spouſe of Chriſt, to all that ever Chriſt hath; it intitles her to all the honours of Chriſt; it intitles her to all the communicable titles of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this Spouſeſhip ſecures the Church the Spouſe of Chriſt, from all arreſt, from acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all ſuits, let the debt be never ſo great, the creditors cannot come neer her for one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; I ſay, the conſideration of this will adde alſo to the exalting and magnifying of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding riches of the grace of God in Chriſt to men, to ſhew what a bleſſed condition this Spouſeſhip is to thoſe that are ſtrangers unto

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle, after his ſuperſciption and direction of his Epiſtle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he makes mention of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for the exerciſe of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall office, and after his Apoſtolicall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction given unto them, comes to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the cauſe of the writing of this Epiſtle. It was this; namely, he had received comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intelligence and information from <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus,</hi> a Miniſter of the Goſpel, that had lobour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among theſe <hi>Coloſſians</hi> of their receiving the faith, and of their love to the brethren. This was glad news to the Apoſtle; and therefore he tells them, that he was not unmindfull or backward to return thanks and praiſe to the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:175622:187"/>Lord for ſo good a work begun in them, and for the joy he had received by the work among them, and alſo to pray for them, making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many particulars he ſought of God on their behalf; namely, <hi>That they may be filled with the knowledge of his wil in all wiſdom and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall underſtanding;</hi> cloſing up in thankfulneſs, in remembrance and reherſall of the fountain and riſe from whence all that grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe received, flowed and ſprung, and that is the dear Son of God, in the 13. verſe. Having thus let himſelf into his own way; namely, the mentioning of the dear Son of God; he takes the oppertunity from an apt connexion, to go on according to the main diſcourſe of this Epiſtle, wherein the Apoſtle firſt ſorts his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and then he falls upon his buſineſſe. The two main matters he deals upon, are, firſt the foundation, and that is the Sonne of God, expreſſed in the 13. verſe: Secondly, the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture raiſed upon this foundation, and that is redemption through his blood, even the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins.</p>
               <p>Here is the diſtribution of his matter. Now, by and by, having ſorted his materialls, he falls to work; beginning firſt w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the foundation, which he poliſheth, that he puts ſuch a luſtre upon it, that it ſhines even like the Sun; yea, more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then the Sun in beauty: He ſets forth Chriſt
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:175622:187"/>the foundation, in ſo many aimable conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to raviſh the world. And the Apoſtle at the 15. and 16. verſes, begins to ſhew his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and expertneſſe in this gret work, that Chriſt did entruſt him withall; namely, to be a wooer in the behalf of Chriſt, to win people to him, as in a former diſcourſe upon this place I have told you; and therein, I ſay, the Apoſtle doth moſt Rhetorically hold forth every thing that is of a winning and deſirable nature to draw forth the love of people unto Chriſt. If people look for beauty, and that catch men, the Apoſtle tells us here, that Chriſt is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable peece of beauty, there is none like to him, ſaith the Church in the <hi>Canticles: He is the chief of ten thouſands;</hi> but, behold, the beauty the Apoſtle mentions here: <hi>He is the Image of the inviſible God.</hi> In the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in the 1. chapter, and the 3. verſe, he ſpeaks more fully to the buſineſſe: <hi>He is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Image of his perſon, and the brightnes of his glory.</hi> Here is a face for you, if you be enamored with beauty, there is none like him. Yea, but ſome they look for parentage, one of Noble blood, and of a great Houſe. As they would have beauty, ſo they would marry into an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Family. Well, the Apoſtle will tell you here is a match for you with a witneſſe: Here is beauty, and a good race too. He is
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:175622:188"/>not only the expreſſe Image of God, but he is the firſt born of God: <hi>The firſt begotten of every creature;</hi> nay, the dear Son of God. In the 15. verſe of this chapter, here is a ſtock for you of the higheſt kindred in the world; hee is, the heir of glory, the heir apparant, that if you will match for honour, if you will match into a great Houſe, here is beauty and honour too. Yea, but you will vay, it may be, he may be in diſgrace, it may be he hath no authority and power, and ability; we would have one that hath authority and power, and bears rule. Chriſt, he is called ſuch a one too; the whole ſoveraignty of the world is at his command and diſpoſall: as you would have it to be, ſo you have it, in the next verſe. In verſ. 16. <hi>All things were made by him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>whether things in heaven, or things in earth, viſible, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, principalities and powers, thrones or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, all things were made by him, &amp; for him;</hi> as much as to ſay, every thing is ſubject unto him, every thing bows their knees to him: And in 2 <hi>Philip.</hi> he hath a name given to him above every name; <hi>that, at the name of Ieſus every knee ſhould bow, whether things in heaven, or things i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> If you will therefore match with advantage to the purpoſe, here is a match for you, ſaith the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:175622:188"/>Apoſtle. I, but ſome will ſay, He may have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour enough himſelf, but it may be he is a nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, I may be kept hard enough, and poore enough; Is he bountifull and free? Beloved, the Apoſtle tells us in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.10. Firſt, what he hath; he is not only honourable, but rich alſo: <hi>In him dwelleth the fulnes of the Godhead bodily,</hi> ſaith he. What is that to me, ſome will ſay, he may hoard it all up, I may have little enough of it. No, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we are compleat in him.</hi> Here is the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and ye are compleat in him; he cannot abide to keep any thing to himſelf: In this he is a Houſholder with a witneſſe; he cannot eat his morſels alone, he muſt impart that he hath. The tender mother, if ſhe have but a bit, the childe muſt have half with her, and participate thereof. And therefore, in the 1. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> he is <hi>full of grace and truth,</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>and of his fulnes we have received grace for grace.</hi> What better Husband can you deſire in the world, then to have his whole purſe at your command? You are not at ſtint and allowance, you may draw till you are weary, there is no ſhutting up of the cheſt of his treaſure; he is a Fountain ſet open for you.</p>
               <p>But to draw towards our purpoſe: There are two offices the Holy Ghoſt is pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us withall, proper unto Chriſt as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:175622:189"/>to win people unto him. The firſt is generall, in reſpect of creation and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over the whole world; the ſecond is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and ſpeciall, over the Church alone, that is the office mentioned in the Text: <hi>He is the head of the body, the Church the beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the words you may obſerve with me, a Propoſition, and an Epoſition, and Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; or an Allegoricall Propoſition, and the expoſition of the Allegory.</p>
               <p>The Allegoricall Propoſition is, <hi>He is the head of the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The interpretation of it is, <hi>He is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the words, note whoſe office this is, that is here ſpoken of; it is he that is the Head, even the Image of the inviſible God, the deare Son of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, note the office it ſelf, what that is. It is <hi>Headſhip; He is the Head of the Church; He is the beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, note among whom this office is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, and for whoſe uſe he doth execute this office, that is, the <hi>body,</hi> interpreted to be the Church, the ſeverall members of Chriſt. I will not ſet down any other Propoſition, but what the Apoſtle hath ſtated in the Text, uſing his own words, <hi>Chriſt is the head of the body, the Church the beginning.</hi> A head, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:175622:189"/>a body, admits of a threefold conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Sometimes it is taken naturally, and ſo proportionably it hath a body conſiſting of naturall members. Sometimes a head is taken politically, and ſo proportionably it hath a body politique. But here it is taken ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a ſpirituall head, and a ſpirituall body: Chriſt is the head, and the Church you ſee, is the body, ſo that this is here a myſticall body. And the Church is called a body, not that it hath a compleatneſſe without a head; but in reference to the head, it is called a part of the whole. A body and a head is but a compleat body indeed. Sometimes the body goes for a part, and ſometimes for the whole. Here it is taken for a part only: But that we are to inſiſt upon is this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to take into conſideration, who this is that is the head.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what this office of Headſhip doth import unto us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how this Head is furniſhed to the office that is proper for a head to a body.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and then, as time will give leave, we will have a word or two of application.</p>
               <p>Firſt, who this Head is; You will ſay, we need not ask the queſtion, it is confeſt by all it is Chriſt. It is true, it is ſo; but yet there is a myſtery in it, and peradventure, the thoughts
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:175622:190"/>of many perſons are ſomething more confuſed in the apprehenſion of Chriſt, as he is Head, then haply they might be. And it may be there might be a more cleer apprehenſion of Chriſt conſidered as he is Head, then yet there is among us. I will therefore as cleerly as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I may, ſtate unto you, under what confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration Chriſt is to be conſidered, being head of his Church, or of his members. Note, for the making way to this, that there are five very diſtinct things in Chrirſt; I ſay, all five diſtinct one from another, and all of them, as you ſhall hear in the cloſure, concurre together in Chriſt as head of the Church.</p>

                  <hi>Iohn:</hi> and the 1. verſ. Chriſt is God, there is but one God in all the world, and therefore you muſt know, that you are never to ſeparate in your thoughts God from Chriſt. Alwaies as you look upon Chriſt, ſo look upon God; or, as you look upon God, look upon God no otherwiſe then as he is in Chriſt, as if there were another God, beſides what Chriſt is; for there is no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, beſides the Godhead, there is the eternall, ineffable perſonality in Chriſt, as he is God, ſo he is the Son. And in this, though we cannot fathome the difference, yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is a perſonall difference between the Fatherhood and the perſon of the Son: There is but one God, as I ſaid before, but the perſons are three; the Father is one, the Son is another, and the Holy Ghoſt is another: <hi>There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.</hi> Now, the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, are not all one perſonally, but the Son is the Son, and the Father is the Father. But the Godhead of the Father, and of the Son is one, that is the true meaning; there is a difference between the perſon of the Father, and the perſon of the Son; but this matter is not to be pryed into by humane wit: For this of all the myſteries in Scripture, is the pure
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:175622:191"/>object of meer faith; there is no humane way to illuſtrate the difference between the eternall Fatherhood and the eternall Sonſhip.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in Chriſt there is a diſtinct hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, that is, as this man is not that man, ſuch a diſtinct individuall human nature Chriſt hath, having a peculiar ſoul and body of his own; that which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſuffered upon the croſſe: diſtinct, I ſay, from our individuall ſouls and bodies.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in Chriſt there is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an ineffable and incomprehenſible hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall Vnion of the divine nature of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon in the Trinity, and humane nature in one perſon. There is difference between the being of God, and man, conſidered ſeverally, and the being of Chriſt as Mediator. The Godhead of Chriſt is not the Mediator ſimply; the Manhood of Chriſt is not the Mediator ſimply conſidered: But God and man in one perſon, as we call it, is the Mediator.</p>
               <p>Finally, Chriſt is to be conſidered not only perſonally, as he is God and man being one individuall perſon by himſelf; but Chriſt is to be conſidered collectively, that is, he is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt as he is one perſon of himſelf; but he is Chriſt, as he himſelf in that one perſon is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nited to the perſons of all the elect in the world. He and they make up but one collective body.</p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:175622:191"/>
               <p>In brief, there is a kinde of trin-union in Chriſt, The divine union which makes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son one. The perſonall union, which makes the divine nature, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature one. The myſticall union which makes Chriſt the Mediator, God and man, one with all the members of Chriſt joyntly. You know, that in reſpect of the laſt conſideration, Chriſt, as he is collectively conſidered, conſiſts of his own perſon as head, and of all the elect as members; ſo that in ſome ſenſe Chriſt cannot be ſaid to be ſeparated, but hath his members knit unto him. A headleſſe body, or a body<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe head, are equally both of them imperfect. If the Church be ſeparated from Chriſt, or Chriſt ſeparated from the Church, he ſhould in the laſt conſideration be imperfect. Now in this Text, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt, doth underſtand him in the laſt conſideration I have ſpoken of; namely, as God the Son united to the humane nature, or rather uniting the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature unto himſelf; as theſe two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in one perſon are united unto the Church or members of Chriſt; ſo Chriſt is the head. It is true, ſometimes you have expreſſions of Chriſts own ſpeaking, by way of ſubjection: <hi>My Father is greater then I:</hi> And, <hi>I came not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me;</hi> which phraſe of Chriſt, being not
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:175622:192"/>rightly underſtood, doth occaſion in the thoughts of men, ſome conceits, as if God were a diſtinct being from Chriſt; that Chriſt makes God here greater then himſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the truth is, there is, as I ſaid before, no God but what Chriſt is. Chriſt doth never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the Godhead of his Father is greater then his own Godhead: For, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne is but one in the Godhead and divine nature; and therefore, when Chriſt in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>peech hath reference unto God, he hath but reference unto the divine nature that is un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed unto his humanity, and the very nature of God is within himſelf; and there is no other but what is within himſelf. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no diſtinct God in the world, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> God that is become man, and is now called Chriſt. Therefore you are never to look upon Chriſt, but as he is the compleat only true God. What need all this diſcourſe, you will ſay? I anſwer, You muſt have Chriſt ſet forth in this conſideration, or elſe you ſhall never be able to reach that he is the head. Therefore the conſideration of the ſecond thing will c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>er the uſefulneſs of the firſt. What this Headſhip is the Text ſaith: <hi>He is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> that is, the root and ſpring from whence things have their firſt being. Now, mark, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, either the Apoſtle muſt ſpeake falſe,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:175622:192"/>when he ſaith, he is <hi>the beginning;</hi> or elſe you muſt conſider Chriſt, as the only God. All the world grants God to be the beginning of all things; therefore, if there be any thing in the world that ſhould be the beginning of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſides Chriſt, he himſelf cannot be the beginning of all things; therefore for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of this prerogative of Chriſt <hi>being the beginning</hi> and fountain, he is to be conſidered alwayes as the only God. Now, this word, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> doth import unto us, that Chriſt is firſt the beginning of being: and ſecondly, the beginning of well being: He is the beginning of being in generall; <hi>All things were made by him, and without him there was nothing made that was made,</hi> John the 1. As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere in this 1. of the <hi>Coloſ. All things were created by him, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſible or inviſible; principalities &amp; powers, thrones or dominions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The main thing the Apoſtle drives at is this: that Chriſt is the beginning of the Church, that is, Chriſt is the beginning of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members of himſelf. Every member of the Church of Chriſt received his firſt being from him, and only from him, and from none other. Conſider the originall beginning of them, even in eternity it ſelf, if it may be properly called a beginning, it hath its being from Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Mark the Apoſtle in the 1. chapter of the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:175622:193"/>Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> 2. and 3. verſes: <hi>Bleſſed be God the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpirituall bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt, according as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundations of the world were laid.</hi> This expreſſion may ſeem to ſome, to import a difference between God and Chriſt or ſomething diſtinct one from the other, as if Chriſt were the ſubject in whom perſons are choſen, and God the Author, by whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are choſen. But, beloved, properly there is no ſuch thing as Chriſt diſtinct from God, ſo as if he were not God. If God be in Chriſt, then it is Chriſt himſelf, as he is God that doth it. And therefore, if you will mark the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion well, it may be, you ſhall ſee that it is Chriſt himſelf hath choſen us. I confeſſe, the words may have a double reference, either to the Father, or to Chriſt; and according to this ſecond reference, Chriſt may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived both the object, and the fountain too, in whom you are choſen; and the expreſſion, perhaps, will bear both: <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him;</hi> that is, according as he in him choſe us. But howſoever, all comes to one effect, the Father and the Son being one God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to come down to particulars: Chriſt is the beginning of a preſent poſſeſſive
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:175622:193"/>being, as perſons are members of him. He is the beginning of a poſſeſſive being, or being in poſſeſſion. Conſider the firſt thing in the being of a member, that is life; life, as it is ſpirituall, and ſo peculiar to a member, hath its firſt riſe from Chriſt himſelf: mark the expreſſion in the 2. chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians; He hath created us in Chriſt Ieſus, unto good works, whereto he hath ordained us, that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> You are created of God in Chriſt Ieſus to good works: or, God in Chriſt hath done it. The very ſelf-ſame phraſe and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the Apoſtle uſeth there to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> he uſeth again in the 2. Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> chap. 5. and verſe 19. Namely, that <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf.</hi> The truth is, It pleaſed the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to unite the humane nature to it ſelf, and ſo to mannage the affairs of the Church in thoſe two natures ſo united; not as if God gave out ſome of himſelf to the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reſerved ſome of it ſelf to it ſelf; but the whole divine nature gave up it ſelf, though only in the ſecond Perſon: <hi>God was in Chriſt,</hi> as much as to ſay, whole God, the divine nature aſſumed a humane nature, and ſo makes up a Chriſt. And thus God is in Chriſt, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world unto himſelf: You ſhall ſee in the Apoſtles expreſſion elſewhere, that the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:175622:194"/>beginning of life in a member of Chriſt flows from Chriſt: <hi>Your life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> It is ſuch another phraſe as the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: <hi>It is hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> that is, it is hid in that God, who by being man, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſt: For that is all the difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Chriſt; all the difference, I ſay, is between God ſimply and abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in himſelf, and God conſidered as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effably united to the humane nature. God, I ſay, thus united, becomes Chriſt; and ſo in ſuch a union is reconciling the world unto himſelf, and takes the Church, who is his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The Apoſtle tells us further, <hi>Now I live,</hi> but he preſently checks himſelf; <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me.</hi> Chriſt is the ſoul of the body, and as the body without a ſoul is dead, ſo a perſon without Chriſt is dead.</p>
               <p>I will not diſpute that needleſſe diſpute of the Philoſophers, whether the ſoul be ſeated in the head principally, or in the heart, but this I am ſure of, the life and ſoul of the Church is in the head of the Church: <hi>I am the way, the truth and the life;</hi> he is the life of the ſoul of man: as the body without the ſoul is dead; even ſo, if there could be ſuch a thing, as the body of the Church without Chriſt, that body were but a dead thing. It hath all animal vertue from him alone: It hath all life
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:175622:194"/>in all reſpects from him. Take life in the firſt fruits, in its ſence or motion, all ſpirituall ſence, all ſpirituall motion, all ſpirituall actions, and activeneſſe for action, receives being and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning only from Chriſt: <hi>Hee is given for a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to open the blind eyes.</hi> All eyes are blind till Chriſt opens them; there is no ſeeing till the body receive ſight and ſeeing from the head. The head cauſeth us alſo to ſinell; as wel as to ſee, the ſweet ſavour of the ointment of Chriſt, that makes the Virgins love him: <hi>Becauſe of the ſweet ſavour of thy oyntments, therefore do the Virgins love thee.</hi> Now, this ſavour, the ſmell thereof, being as the ſmel of a field that the Lord hath bleſſed, to ſmel this, is the ſole work of Chriſt himſelfe: So alſo the ſpiritual taſte, to taſt how good God is, to reliſh the fatneſſe, and marrow, and ſweetneſſe of the ſpirituall wine well refined upon the lees, is all by the power of Chriſt, and hath its being from Chriſt: So all our feeling, to feel comfort, joy unſpeakable, and glorious, all is from Chriſt; Chriſt opens our eyes, he boars the eares, he cauſeth us to ſmell.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, all this is the worke of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; why doe you ſay it is the work of Chriſt? Mark what <hi>John</hi> ſaith in the 16. chapter, the words are theſe: <hi>He,</hi> that is, <hi>the ſpirit ſhal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me: For he ſhall receive of mine, and he ſhall
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:175622:195"/>ſhew it unto you.</hi> The Spirit himſelfe, as he dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with the members of Chriſt, is the agent of Chriſt proceeding from Chriſt, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating that that is Chriſts to thoſe members. So that the Spirit is, as it were, the conduit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, through whom the fulneſſe of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine conveyes it ſelfe, and runs forth to every member. The Spirit is as the veins and nerves in the naturall body. The blood, you know, hath its fountain from the liver: but the veins carry it into every part of the body: And as the naturall eye cannot ſee, except the nerves feed it with viſive ſpirits; ſo neither can any eye behold the ſecrets of the Lord, the hidden things of Chriſt, ſuch as he thanks his Father, hee reveales unto babes, while he hides them from the wiſe of the world, except the Lord Chriſt do feed the members with his own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. It is not the eye that doth diſcerne and ſee of it ſelfe, but the ſpirits that do come from the head, cauſe ſight by the eye: For there may be an eye, and no ſight; where a want of theſe ſpirits are. Looke over all the Book of God, and you ſhall finde, that there is no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that comes from the Spirit, but Chriſt is the head and ſpring of it. You ſhall finde the ſtrength and hearts of people faile when hee withdrawes himſelfe. It is hee that is the ſtrength of them for ever: <hi>Feare not,</hi> ſaith the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:175622:195"/>Text, <hi>be not diſmayed; I will uphold thee, I will ſtrengthen thee.</hi> There muſt needs be miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for want of power, except Chriſt come with his ſtrength and power to uphold. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts thoſe to whom he writes, to worke the workes of the Lord, hee gives them this counſel: <hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might:</hi> and again, ſaith hee, <hi>Put on the whole armour of God.</hi> Now it is a vain thing to think of taking up of arms, except there be ſtrength to manage them. <hi>Saul</hi> thought <hi>David</hi> to be a puny, when he was to ſight with <hi>Goliah,</hi> and had no regard to him, although hee might have good armour on; hee was too little a man; What <hi>Saul</hi> thought of <hi>David,</hi> is true of all the whole armour of God, it is to no purpoſe, except men be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. And therefore, when <hi>Paul</hi> was in a ſtrait, hee begged, and begged again, to have ſtrength given, though hee had not an anſwer to his mind, yet God told him: <hi>My grace is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for thee; My ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſſe.</hi> All perſons are weak, but as they have ſtrength in Chriſt. Yea, there is no ſtrength but what is his, and is ſent by him. Let me tell you this, and I beſeech you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they that have Chriſt for their head, they have an infinite advantage above the cloſeſt
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:175622:196"/>hypocrite in the world, although he goe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo farre: All he doth is but from a weake principle; Chriſt is not the principle of that hee doth: but hee that hath Chriſt for his head, hee hath a ſpring of fulneſſe. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt tells us; <hi>He is full of Grace and Truth;</hi> and, <hi>in him dwells the fulneſſe of the God-head bodily:</hi> and, <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him all fulneſſe ſhould dwell:</hi> So that you may plainely ſee, that the preaching of Chriſt as head, and ſetting up of all the glory of Chriſt, is not the preaching of licentious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to men. Hee that can win a perſon to be a true member of this head, that is Chriſt, hee brings that perſon into a fat ſoile; hee tranſplants him from a barren ſoile, from a rocky ſoil, into a rich ſoile; whereby he come to abound in all manner of fruitfulneſſe. And certainly, beloved, fruitfulneſſe will be more abundant, as the ſoule can apprehend it ſelfe by true faith to be a part of this head: For, the head will communicate that the ſoule it ſelfe cannot contain it ſelfe in its own bounds: <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraines me</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> hee can doe no otherwiſe; hee that is driven muſt needs goe: Chriſt he drives, and makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a way into his members; hee breakes his own way into them, and ſo ſets them on, and puts them forwards.</p>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:175622:196"/>
               <p>Then again, Chriſt being the beginning of all our being, he is the beginning alſo of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives &amp; priviledges whatſoever the Church of Chriſt hath; they have no priviledge but as it flows from the grant of Chriſt: As firſt of all, Juſtification; even Juſtification it ſelfe comes from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It may be that you will object, that the Text ſaith, that <hi>God juſtifies the ungodly,</hi> and how then doth Chriſt juſtifie them?</p>
               <p>I ſay ſtill as I ſaid before: That which God doth, Chriſt doth; God is ſtill in Chriſt; God doth nothing, but Chriſt doth all things. All the Father hath, he hath given to the Son: <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.</hi> The meaning, I take it, is this: God, as hee is ſimply one divine eſſence in himſelf, he doth in this ſimple conſideration of himſelf, not manage any thing in this kind: but all that ever he manageth, he manageth in his Son; and this Son, as he is become man. So that whoſoever they are that are juſtified, they are juſtified by the Sonne; and whoſoever come to the knowledge of Juſtification, they attaine to the knowledg of Juſtification alſo by Chriſt: <hi>We have not received the ſpirit of the world, but wee have received the Spirit that is of God; that wee may know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> Now, this Spirit of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:175622:197"/>God, is the Spirit of Chriſt: So then, the knowledge of the things freely given us of God, is by the Spirit of Chriſt. Nothing can acquaint the ſoule, and ſatisfie it of a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and intereſt in Chriſt, and being a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt, but by the Spirit of God; that muſt reſolve the caſe at laſt, do what you can. Every thing is dumb and ſilent: but as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth ſpeak. The Word of God, and even the word of grace, is a dumb letter, but as the Spirit of the Lord doth ſpeak in it, or with it; and ſo of all things in the world. And therefore, beloved, know, you run into thoſe two great evills the Holy Ghoſt ſpeakes of in <hi>Jeremiah;</hi> the forſaking <hi>the fountaine of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving water,</hi> and, <hi>the digging to your ſelves ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns that can hold no water;</hi> while you forſake Chriſt the ſpring &amp; fountain, and go to pump and fetch any thing you take from any thing beſides him: If you run to creatures, you make not Chriſt the beginning.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, you ſuppoſe Chriſt to be the beginning in all, and you believe him ſo to be. But, I ſay, Is this a good ſuppoſition of Chriſt, when he is not thought of, ſhall he be but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed? and ſhall ſervices be ſet up to take up all the affections, and all the ſuits and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of your hearts? How hath Chriſt all the priority? In the 18. verſe of the 1. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:175622:197"/>to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> hee is ſaid to be the head of the body of the Church: <hi>That hee might have the pre-eminence in all things.</hi> Why do people then run to other things, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, and extoll, and exalt other things, while Chriſt ſhall not have a good word? Nay, people are affraid to ſpeake out of things that are Chriſts, for fear of giving liberty to people to ſin, and charge people to take heed of the ſetting forth of Chriſt and Grace by him, as a dangerous Doctrine: So ſeldome daring to ſpeake of the excellencies of Chriſt, and of the excellent priviledges and benefits that come by and from Chriſt; nor of the freeneſſe of thoſe things that are conveyed to us, in, and through Chriſt. And why? Oh! this will make men run out into all manner of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and prophaneneſſe, without controll; and ſo Chriſt ſhall be ſuppreſſed, for feare of giving liberty, and in the meane while other things ſhall bee ſet up above Chriſt: the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Rhetorick of Repentance, and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the prevalency of teares to waſh away ſin, and our conſcionable walking will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us to GOD at the laſt day. Here muſt bee a magnifying of mans righteouſneſſe, and when theſe things come to be examined, they are but rhetoricall expreſſions. Beloved, God grant that our Rhetorick may advance him,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:175622:198"/>that is to bee advanced, and keepe all other things in their own places, that are to be kept low, that nothing may have the preeminence of Chriſt, Chriſt being the head and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all things; that the people of God may go with their buckets to the wells of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and draw waters of life from thence, and not runne to muddy puddles. The zeale of the Lord, I meane of the Lord Chriſt, who hath ſo magnified the riches of his grace to the Sons of men, ſhould eat up your ſpirits, &amp; raiſe up your ſoules againſt every thing that doth raiſe it ſelfe up, to exalt it ſelf above Chriſt. If Chriſt be not the beginning, but ſomthing elſe, let that have the preeminence; but if Chriſt be the beginning let him have the preeminence: as <hi>Eliah</hi> once ſaid to the Idolatrous <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that had fortaken the Lord, &amp; had ſet up the works of their own hands inſtead of him; <hi>If Baal be God, then worſhip him; but if God be God, then ſerve and worſhip him:</hi> So I ſay, at this preſent unto you: If you will acknowledge Chriſt to be the beginning, let it appear in the ſetting of him up above all other things in your hearts and thoughts. Make him your ſanctuary, make him your refuge, wait upon him for all things. Why are your hearts ſo caſt downe?
